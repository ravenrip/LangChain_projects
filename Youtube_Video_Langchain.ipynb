              "[Document(page_content='Chris Anderson: Elon Musk,\\ngreat to see you. How are you? Elon Musk: Good. How are you? CA: We\\'re here at the Texas Gigafactory\\nthe day before this thing opens. It\\'s been pretty crazy out there. Thank you so much\\nfor making time on a busy day. I would love you to help us,\\nkind of, cast our minds, I don\\'t know, 10, 20,\\n30 years into the future. And help us try to picture\\nwhat it would take to build a future that\\'s worth\\ngetting excited about. The last time you spoke at TED, you said that that was really\\njust a big driver. You know, you can talk about lots of other\\nreasons to do the work you\\'re doing, but fundamentally, you want\\nto think about the future and not think that it sucks. EM: Yeah, absolutely. I think in general, you know, there\\'s a lot of discussion of like,\\nthis problem or that problem. And a lot of people are sad\\nabout the future and they\\'re ... Pessimistic. And I think ... this is ... This is not great. I mean, we really want\\nto wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited\\nabout what\\'s going to happen. And life cannot simply be about sort of, solving one miserable\\nproblem after another. CA: So if you look forward 30 years,\\nyou know, the year 2050 has been labeled by scientists as this, kind of, almost like this\\ndoomsday deadline on climate. There\\'s a consensus of scientists,\\na large consensus of scientists, who believe that if we haven\\'t\\ncompletely eliminated greenhouse gases or offset them completely by 2050, effectively we\\'re inviting\\nclimate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway\\nto avoid that catastrophe? And what would it look like? EM: Yeah, so I am not one\\nof the doomsday people, which may surprise you. I actually think we\\'re on a good path. But at the same time, I want to caution against complacency. So, so long as we are not complacent, as long as we have a high sense of urgency about moving towards\\na sustainable energy economy, then I think things will be fine. So I can\\'t emphasize that enough, as long as we push hard\\nand are not complacent, the future is going to be great. Don\\'t worry about it. I mean, worry about it, but if you worry about it, ironically,\\nit will be a self-unfulfilling prophecy. So, like, there are three elements\\nto a sustainable energy future. One is of sustainable energy generation,\\nwhich is primarily wind and solar. There\\'s also hydro, geothermal, I\\'m actually pro-nuclear. I think nuclear is fine. But it\\'s going to be primarily\\nsolar and wind, as the primary generators of energy. The second part is you need batteries\\nto store the solar and wind energy because the sun\\ndoesn\\'t shine all the time, the wind doesn\\'t blow all the time. So it\\'s a lot of stationary battery packs. And then you need electric transport. So electric cars, electric planes, boats. And then ultimately, it’s not really possible\\nto make electric rockets, but you can make\\nthe propellant used in rockets using sustainable energy. So ultimately, we can have a fully\\nsustainable energy economy. And it\\'s those three things: solar/wind, stationary\\nbattery pack, electric vehicles. So then what are the limiting\\nfactors on progress? The limiting factor really will be\\nbattery cell production. So that\\'s going to really be\\nthe fundamental rate driver. And then whatever the slowest element of the whole lithium-ion\\nbattery cells supply chain, from mining and the many steps of refining to ultimately creating a battery cell and putting it into a pack, that will be the limiting factor\\non progress towards sustainability. CA: All right, so we need to talk\\nmore about batteries, because the key thing\\nthat I want to understand, like, there seems to be\\na scaling issue here that is kind of amazing and alarming. You have said that you have calculated that the amount of battery production\\nthat the world needs for sustainability is 300 terawatt hours of batteries. That\\'s the end goal? EM: Very rough numbers, and I certainly would invite others\\nto check our calculations because they may arrive\\nat different conclusions. But in order to transition, not just\\ncurrent electricity production, but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the amount\\nof electricity that you need, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt\\nhours of installed capacity. CA: So we need to give people\\na sense of how big a task that is. I mean, here we are at the Gigafactory. You know, this is one of the biggest\\nbuildings in the world. What I\\'ve read, and tell me\\nif this is still right, is that the goal here is to eventually\\nproduce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here a year eventually. EM: We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully we get there\\nwithin a couple of years. CA: Right. But I mean, that is one -- EM: 0.1 terrawat hours. CA: But that\\'s still 1/100\\nof what\\'s needed. How much of the rest of that 100\\nis Tesla planning to take on let\\'s say, between now and 2030, 2040, when we really need to see\\nthe scale up happen? EM: I mean, these are just guesses. So please, people shouldn\\'t\\nhold me to these things. It\\'s not like this is like some -- What tends to happen\\nis I\\'ll make some like, you know, best guess and then people, in five years, there’ll be some jerk\\nthat writes an article: \"Elon said this would happen,\\nand it didn\\'t happen. He\\'s a liar and a fool.\" It\\'s very annoying when that happens. So these are just guesses,\\nthis is a conversation. CA: Right. EM: I think Tesla probably ends up\\ndoing 10 percent of that. Roughly. CA: Let\\'s say 2050 we have this amazing, you know,\\n100 percent sustainable electric grid made up of, you know, some mixture\\nof the sustainable energy sources you talked about. That same grid probably\\nis offering the world really low-cost energy, isn\\'t it, compared with now. And I\\'m curious about like, are people entitled to get\\na little bit excited about the possibilities of that world? EM: People should be optimistic\\nabout the future. Humanity will solve sustainable energy. It will happen if we, you know,\\ncontinue to push hard, the future is bright and good\\nfrom an energy standpoint. And then it will be possible to also use\\nthat energy to do carbon sequestration. It takes a lot of energy to pull\\ncarbon out of the atmosphere because in putting it in the atmosphere\\nit releases energy. So now, you know, obviously\\nin order to pull it out, you need to use a lot of energy. But if you\\'ve got a lot of sustainable\\nenergy from wind and solar, you can actually sequester carbon. So you can reverse the CO2 parts\\nper million of the atmosphere and oceans. And also you can really have\\nas much fresh water as you want. Earth is mostly water. We should call Earth “Water.” It\\'s 70 percent water by surface area. Now most of that’s seawater, but it\\'s like we just happen to be\\non the bit that\\'s land. CA: And with energy,\\nyou can turn seawater into -- EM: Yes. CA: Irrigating water\\nor whatever water you need. EM: At very low cost. Things will be good. CA: Things will be good. And also, there\\'s other benefits\\nto this non-fossil fuel world where the air is cleaner -- EM: Yes, exactly. Because, like, when you burn fossil fuels, there\\'s all these side reactions and toxic gases of various kinds. And sort of little particulates\\nthat are bad for your lungs. Like, there\\'s all sorts\\nof bad things that are happening that will go away. And the sky will be cleaner and quieter. The future\\'s going to be good. CA: I want us to switch now to think\\na bit about artificial intelligence. But the segue there, you mentioned how annoying it is\\nwhen people call you up for bad predictions in the past. So I\\'m possibly going to be annoying now, but I’m curious about your timelines\\nand how you predict and how come some things are so amazingly\\non the money and some aren\\'t. So when it comes to predicting sales\\nof Tesla vehicles, for example, you\\'ve kind of been amazing, I think in 2014 when Tesla\\nhad sold that year 60,000 cars, you said, \"2020, I think we will do\\nhalf a million a year.\" EM: Yeah, we did\\nalmost exactly a half million. CA: You did almost exactly half a million. You were scoffed in 2014\\nbecause no one since Henry Ford, with the Model T, had come close\\nto that kind of growth rate for cars. You were scoffed, and you actually\\nhit 500,000 cars and then 510,000 or whatever produced. But five years ago,\\nlast time you came to TED, I asked you about full self-driving, and you said, “Yeah, this very year, I\\'m confident that we will have a car\\ngoing from LA to New York without any intervention.\" EM: Yeah, I don\\'t want to blow your mind,\\nbut I\\'m not always right. CA: (Laughs) What\\'s the difference between those two? Why has full self-driving in particular\\nbeen so hard to predict? EM: I mean, the thing that really got me, and I think it\\'s going to get\\na lot of other people, is that there are just so many\\nfalse dawns with self-driving, where you think you\\'ve got the problem, have a handle on the problem, and then it, no, turns out\\nyou just hit a ceiling. Because if you were to plot the progress, the progress looks like a log curve. So it\\'s like a series of log curves. So most people don\\'t know\\nwhat a log curve is, I suppose. CA: Show the shape with your hands. EM: It goes up you know,\\nsort of a fairly straight way, and then it starts tailing off and you start getting diminishing returns. And you\\'re like, uh oh, it was trending up and now\\nit\\'s sort of, curving over and you start getting to these,\\nwhat I call local maxima, where you don\\'t realize\\nbasically how dumb you were. And then it happens again. And ultimately... These things, you know,\\nin retrospect, they seem obvious, but in order to solve\\nfull self-driving properly, you actually have to solve real-world AI. Because what are the road networks\\ndesigned to work with? They\\'re designed to work\\nwith a biological neural net, our brains, and with vision, our eyes. And so in order to make it\\nwork with computers, you basically need to solve\\nreal-world AI and vision. Because we need cameras and silicon neural nets in order to have self-driving work for a system that was designed\\nfor eyes and biological neural nets. You know, I guess\\nwhen you put it that way, it\\'s sort of, like, quite obvious that the only way\\nto solve full self-driving is to solve real world AI\\nand sophisticated vision. CA: What do you feel\\nabout the current architecture? Do you think you have an architecture now where there is a chance for the logarithmic curve\\nnot to tail off any anytime soon? EM: Well I mean, admittedly\\nthese may be infamous last words, but I actually am confident\\nthat we will solve it this year. That we will exceed -- The probability of an accident, at what point do you exceed\\nthat of the average person? I think we will exceed that this year. CA: What are you seeing behind the scenes\\nthat gives you that confidence? EM: We’re almost at the point\\nwhere we have a high-quality unified vector space. In the beginning, we were trying\\nto do this with image recognition on individual images. But if you get one image out of a video, it\\'s actually quite hard to see\\nwhat\\'s going on without ambiguity. But if you look at a video segment\\nof a few seconds of video, that ambiguity resolves. So the first thing we had to do\\nis tie all eight cameras together so they\\'re synchronized, so that all the frames\\nare looked at simultaneously and labeled simultaneously by one person, because we still need human labeling. So at least they’re not labeled\\nat different times by different people in different ways. So it\\'s sort of a surround picture. Then a very important part\\nis to add the time dimension. So that you’re looking at surround video, and you\\'re labeling surround video. And this is actually quite difficult to do\\nfrom a software standpoint. We had to write our own labeling tools and then create auto labeling, create auto labeling software to amplify\\nthe efficiency of human labelers because it’s quite hard to label. In the beginning,\\nit was taking several hours to label a 10-second video clip. This is not scalable. So basically what you have to have\\nis you have to have surround video, and that surround video has to be\\nprimarily automatically labeled with humans just being editors and making slight corrections\\nto the labeling of the video and then feeding back those corrections\\ninto the future auto labeler, so you get this flywheel eventually where the auto labeler\\nis able to take in vast amounts of video and with high accuracy, automatically label the video\\nfor cars, lane lines, drive space. CA: What you’re saying is ... the result of this is that you\\'re\\neffectively giving the car a 3D model of the actual objects\\nthat are all around it. It knows what they are, and it knows how fast they are moving. And the remaining task is to predict what the quirky behaviors are\\nthat, you know, that when a pedestrian is walking\\ndown the road with a smaller pedestrian, that maybe that smaller pedestrian\\nmight do something unpredictable or things like that. You have to build into it\\nbefore you can really call it safe. EM: You basically need to have\\nmemory across time and space. So what I mean by that is ... Memory can’t be infinite, because it\\'s using up a lot\\nof the computer\\'s RAM basically. So you have to say how much\\nare you going to try to remember? It\\'s very common\\nfor things to be occluded. So if you talk about say,\\na pedestrian walking past a truck where you saw the pedestrian start\\non one side of the truck, then they\\'re occluded by the truck. You would know intuitively, OK, that pedestrian is going to pop out\\nthe other side, most likely. CA: A computer doesn\\'t know it. EM: You need to slow down. CA: A skeptic is going to say\\nthat every year for the last five years, you\\'ve kind of said, well, no this is the year, we\\'re confident that it will be there\\nin a year or two or, you know, like it\\'s always been about that far away. But we\\'ve got a new architecture now, you\\'re seeing enough improvement\\nbehind the scenes to make you not certain,\\nbut pretty confident, that, by the end of this year, what in most, not in every city,\\nand every circumstance but in many cities and circumstances, basically the car will be able\\nto drive without interventions safer than a human. EM: Yes. I mean, the car currently\\ndrives me around Austin most of the time with no interventions. So it\\'s not like ... And we have over 100,000 people in our full self-driving beta program. So you can look at the videos\\nthat they post online. CA: I do. And some of them are great,\\nand some of them are a little terrifying. I mean, occasionally\\nthe car seems to veer off and scare the hell out of people. EM: It’s still a beta. CA: But you’re behind the scenes,\\nlooking at the data, you\\'re seeing enough improvement to believe that a this-year\\ntimeline is real. EM: Yes, that\\'s what it seems like. I mean, we could be here\\ntalking again in a year, like, well, another year went by,\\nand it didn’t happen. But I think this is the year. CA: And so in general,\\nwhen people talk about Elon time, I mean it sounds like\\nyou can\\'t just have a general rule that if you predict that something\\nwill be done in six months, actually what we should imagine\\nis it’s going to be a year or it’s like two-x or three-x,\\nit depends on the type of prediction. Some things, I guess,\\nthings involving software, AI, whatever, are fundamentally harder\\nto predict than others. Is there an element that you actually deliberately make\\naggressive prediction timelines to drive people to be ambitious? Without that, nothing gets done? EM: Well, I generally believe,\\nin terms of internal timelines, that we want to set the most aggressive\\ntimeline that we can. Because there’s sort of like\\na law of gaseous expansion where, for schedules, where\\nwhatever time you set, it\\'s not going to be less than that. It\\'s very rare\\nthat it\\'ll be less than that. But as far as our predictions\\nare concerned, what tends to happen in the media is that they will report\\nall the wrong ones and ignore all the right ones. Or, you know, when writing\\nan article about me -- I\\'ve had a long career\\nin multiple industries. If you list my sins, I sound\\nlike the worst person on Earth. But if you put those\\nagainst the things I\\'ve done right, it makes much more sense, you know? So essentially like,\\nthe longer you do anything, the more mistakes\\nthat you will make cumulatively. Which, if you sum up those mistakes, will sound like I\\'m the worst\\npredictor ever. But for example, for Tesla vehicle growth, I said I think we’d do 50 percent,\\nand we’ve done 80 percent. CA: Yes. EM: But they don\\'t mention that one. So, I mean, I\\'m not sure what my exact\\ntrack record is on predictions. They\\'re more optimistic than pessimistic,\\nbut they\\'re not all optimistic. Some of them are exceeded\\nprobably more or later, but they do come true. It\\'s very rare that they do not come true. It\\'s sort of like, you know, if there\\'s some radical\\ntechnology prediction, the point is not\\nthat it was a few years late, but that it happened at all. That\\'s the more important part. CA: So it feels like\\nat some point in the last year, seeing the progress on understanding, the Tesla AI understanding\\nthe world around it, led to a kind of, an aha moment at Tesla. Because you really surprised people\\nrecently when you said probably the most important\\nproduct development going on at Tesla this year\\nis this robot, Optimus. EM: Yes. CA: Many companies out there\\nhave tried to put out these robots, they\\'ve been working on them for years. And so far no one has really cracked it. There\\'s no mass adoption\\nrobot in people\\'s homes. There are some in manufacturing,\\nbut I would say, no one\\'s kind of, really cracked it. Is it something that happened in the development of full self-driving\\nthat gave you the confidence to say, \"You know what, we could do\\nsomething special here.\" EM: Yeah, exactly. So, you know, it took me a while\\nto sort of realize that in order to solve self-driving, you really needed to solve real-world AI. And at the point of which you solve\\nreal-world AI for a car, which is really a robot on four wheels, you can then generalize that\\nto a robot on legs as well. The two hard parts I think -- like obviously companies\\nlike Boston Dynamics have shown that it\\'s possible\\nto make quite compelling, sometimes alarming robots. CA: Right. EM: You know, so from a sensors\\nand actuators standpoint, it\\'s certainly been demonstrated by many that it\\'s possible to make\\na humanoid robot. The things that are currently missing\\nare enough intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world\\nand do useful things without being explicitly instructed. So the missing things are basically\\nreal-world intelligence and scaling up manufacturing. Those are two things\\nthat Tesla is very good at. And so then we basically just need\\nto design the specialized actuators and sensors that are needed\\nfor humanoid robot. People have no idea,\\nthis is going to be bigger than the car. CA: So let\\'s dig into exactly that. I mean, in one way, it\\'s actually\\nan easier problem than full self-driving because instead of an object\\ngoing along at 60 miles an hour, which if it gets it wrong,\\nsomeone will die. This is an object that\\'s engineered\\nto only go at what, three or four or five miles an hour. And so a mistake,\\nthere aren\\'t lives at stake. There might be embarrassment at stake. EM: So long as the AI doesn\\'t take it over\\nand murder us in our sleep or something. CA: Right. (Laughter) So talk about -- I think the first applications\\nyou\\'ve mentioned are probably going to be manufacturing, but eventually the vision is to have\\nthese available for people at home. If you had a robot that really understood\\nthe 3D architecture of your house and knew where every object\\nin that house was or was supposed to be, and could recognize all those objects, I mean, that’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? Like the kind of thing\\nthat you could ask a robot to do would be what? Like, tidy up? EM: Yeah, absolutely. Make dinner, I guess, mow the lawn. CA: Take a cup of tea to grandma\\nand show her family pictures. EM: Exactly. Take care\\nof my grandmother and make sure -- CA: It could obviously recognize\\neveryone in the home. It could play catch with your kids. EM: Yes. I mean, obviously,\\nwe need to be careful this doesn\\'t become a dystopian situation. I think one of the things\\nthat\\'s going to be important is to have a localized\\nROM chip on the robot that cannot be updated over the air. Where if you, for example, were to say,\\n“Stop, stop, stop,” if anyone said that, then the robot would stop,\\nyou know, type of thing. And that\\'s not updatable remotely. I think it\\'s going to be important\\nto have safety features like that. CA: Yeah, that sounds wise. EM: And I do think there should be\\na regulatory agency for AI. I\\'ve said that for many years. I don\\'t love being regulated, but I think this is an important\\nthing for public safety. CA: Let\\'s come back to that. But I don\\'t think many people\\nhave really sort of taken seriously the notion of, you know, a robot at home. I mean, at the start\\nof the computing revolution, Bill Gates said there\\'s going to be\\na computer in every home. And people at the time said, yeah,\\nwhatever, who would even want that. Do you think there will be basically\\nlike in, say, 2050 or whatever, like a robot in most homes,\\nis what there will be, and people will love them\\nand count on them? You’ll have your own butler basically. EM: Yeah, you\\'ll have your sort of\\nbuddy robot probably, yeah. CA: I mean, how much of a buddy? How many applications have you thought, you know, can you have\\na romantic partner, a sex partner? EM: It\\'s probably inevitable. I mean, I did promise the internet\\nthat I’d make catgirls. We could make a robot catgirl. CA: Be careful what\\nyou promise the internet. (Laughter) EM: So, yeah, I guess it\\'ll be\\nwhatever people want really, you know. CA: What sort of timeline\\nshould we be thinking about of the first models\\nthat are actually made and sold? EM: Well, you know, the first units\\nthat we intend to make are for jobs that are dangerous,\\nboring, repetitive, and things that people don\\'t want to do. And, you know, I think we’ll have like\\nan interesting prototype sometime this year. We might have something useful next year, but I think quite likely\\nwithin at least two years. And then we\\'ll see\\nrapid growth year over year of the usefulness\\nof the humanoid robots and decrease in cost\\nand scaling up production. CA: Initially just selling to businesses, or when do you picture\\nyou\\'ll start selling them where you can buy your parents one\\nfor Christmas or something? EM: I\\'d say in less than ten years. CA: Help me on the economics of this. So what do you picture the cost\\nof one of these being? EM: Well, I think the cost is actually\\nnot going to be crazy high. Like less than a car. Initially, things will be expensive\\nbecause it\\'ll be a new technology at low production volume. The complexity and cost of a car\\nis greater than that of a humanoid robot. So I would expect that it\\'s going\\nto be less than a car, or at least equivalent to a cheap car. CA: So even if it starts at 50k,\\nwithin a few years, it’s down to 20k or lower or whatever. And maybe for home\\nthey\\'ll get much cheaper still. But think about the economics of this. If you can replace a $30,000, $40,000-a-year worker, which you have to pay every year, with a one-time payment of $25,000 for a robot that can work longer hours, a pretty rapid replacement\\nof certain types of jobs. How worried should\\nthe world be about that? EM: I wouldn\\'t worry about the sort of,\\nputting people out of a job thing. I think we\\'re actually going to have,\\nand already do have, a massive shortage of labor. So I think we will have ... Not people out of work, but actually still a shortage\\nlabor even in the future. But this really will be\\na world of abundance. Any goods and services will be available\\nto anyone who wants them. It\\'ll be so cheap to have goods\\nand services, it will be ridiculous. CA: I\\'m presuming it should be possible\\nto imagine a bunch of goods and services that can\\'t profitably be made now\\nbut could be made in that world, courtesy of legions of robots. EM: Yeah. It will be a world of abundance. The only scarcity\\nthat will exist in the future is that which we decide to create\\nourselves as humans. CA: OK. So AI is allowing us to imagine\\na differently powered economy that will create this abundance. What are you most worried\\nabout going wrong? EM: Well, like I said,\\nAI and robotics will bring out what might be termed the age of abundance. Other people have used this word, and that this is my prediction: it will be an age of abundance \\nfor everyone. But I guess there’s ... The dangers would be\\nthe artificial general intelligence or digital superintelligence decouples\\nfrom a collective human will and goes in the direction\\nthat for some reason we don\\'t like. Whatever direction it might go. You know, that’s sort of\\nthe idea behind Neuralink, is to try to more tightly couple\\ncollective human world to digital superintelligence. And also along the way solve a lot\\nof brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing. So even if it doesn\\'t succeed\\nin the greater goal, I think it will succeed in the goal\\nof alleviating brain and spine damage. CA: So the spirit there is\\nthat if we\\'re going to make these AIs that are so vastly intelligent,\\nwe ought to be wired directly to them so that we ourselves can have\\nthose superpowers more directly. But that doesn\\'t seem to avoid\\nthe risk that those superpowers might ... turn ugly in unintended ways. EM: I think it\\'s a risk, I agree. I\\'m not saying that I have\\nsome certain answer to that risk. I’m just saying like maybe one of the things\\nthat would be good for ensuring that the future\\nis one that we want is to more tightly couple the collective human world\\nto digital intelligence. The issue that we face here\\nis that we are already a cyborg, if you think about it. The computers are\\nan extension of ourselves. And when we die, we have,\\nlike, a digital ghost. You know, all of our text messages\\nand social media, emails. And it\\'s quite eerie actually, when someone dies but everything\\nonline is still there. But you say like, what\\'s the limitation? What is it that inhibits\\na human-machine symbiosis? It\\'s the data rate. When you communicate,\\nespecially with a phone, you\\'re moving your thumbs very slowly. So you\\'re like moving\\nyour two little meat sticks at a rate that’s maybe 10 bits per second,\\noptimistically, 100 bits per second. And computers are communicating\\nat the gigabyte level and beyond. CA: Have you seen evidence\\nthat the technology is actually working, that you\\'ve got a richer, sort of,\\nhigher bandwidth connection, if you like, between like external\\nelectronics and a brain than has been possible before? EM: Yeah. I mean, the fundamental principles\\nof reading neurons, sort of doing read-write on neurons\\nwith tiny electrodes, have been demonstrated for decades. So it\\'s not like the concept is new. The problem is that there is\\nno product that works well that you can go and buy. So it\\'s all sort of, in research labs. And it\\'s like some cords\\nsticking out of your head. And it\\'s quite gruesome,\\nand it\\'s really ... There\\'s no good product\\nthat actually does a good job and is high-bandwidth and safe and something actually that you could buy\\nand would want to buy. But the way to think\\nof the Neuralink device is kind of like a Fitbit\\nor an Apple Watch. That\\'s where we take out\\nsort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter, replace that with what, in many ways really is very much like\\na Fitbit, Apple Watch or some kind of smart watch thing. But with tiny, tiny wires, very, very tiny wires. Wires so tiny, it’s hard to even see them. And it\\'s very important\\nto have very tiny wires so that when they’re implanted,\\nthey don’t damage the brain. CA: How far are you from putting\\nthese into humans? EM: Well, we have put in\\nour FDA application to aspirationally do the first\\nhuman implant this year. CA: The first uses will be\\nfor neurological injuries of different kinds. But rolling the clock forward and imagining when people\\nare actually using these for their own enhancement, let\\'s say, and for the enhancement of the world, how clear are you in your mind as to what it will feel like\\nto have one of these inside your head? EM: Well, I do want to emphasize\\nwe\\'re at an early stage. And so it really will be\\nmany years before we have anything approximating\\na high-bandwidth neural interface that allows for AI-human symbiosis. For many years, we will just be solving\\nbrain injuries and spinal injuries. For probably a decade. This is not something\\nthat will suddenly one day it will have this incredible\\nsort of whole brain interface. It\\'s going to be, like I said, at least a decade of really\\njust solving brain injuries and spinal injuries. And really, I think you can solve\\na very wide range of brain injuries, including severe depression,\\nmorbid obesity, sleep, potentially schizophrenia, like, a lot of things that cause\\ngreat stress to people. Restoring memory in older people. CA: If you can pull that off,\\nthat\\'s the app I will sign up for. EM: Absolutely. CA: Please hurry. (Laughs) EM: I mean, the emails that we get\\nat Neuralink are heartbreaking. I mean, they\\'ll send us\\njust tragic, you know, where someone was sort of,\\nin the prime of life and they had an accident on a motorcycle and someone who\\'s 25, you know,\\ncan\\'t even feed themselves. And this is something we could fix. CA: But you have said that AI is one\\nof the things you\\'re most worried about and that Neuralink may be one of the ways where we can keep abreast of it. EM: Yeah, there\\'s the short-term thing, which I think is helpful on an individual\\nhuman level with injuries. And then the long-term thing is an attempt to address the civilizational risk of AI by bringing digital intelligence and biological intelligence\\ncloser together. I mean, if you think of how\\nthe brain works today, there are really two layers to the brain. There\\'s the limbic system and the cortex. You\\'ve got the kind of,\\nanimal brain where -- it’s kind of like the fun part, really. CA: It\\'s where most of Twitter\\noperates, by the way. EM: I think Tim Urban said, we’re like somebody, you know,\\nstuck a computer on a monkey. You know, so we\\'re like,\\nif you gave a monkey a computer, that\\'s our cortex. But we still have a lot\\nof monkey instincts. Which we then try to rationalize\\nas, no, it\\'s not a monkey instinct. It’s something more important than that. But it\\'s often just really\\na monkey instinct. We\\'re just monkeys with a computer\\nstuck in our brain. But even though the cortex\\nis sort of the smart, or the intelligent part of the brain, the thinking part of the brain, I\\'ve not yet met anyone\\nwho wants to delete their limbic system or their cortex. They\\'re quite happy having both. Everyone wants both parts of their brain. And people really want their\\nphones and their computers, which are really the tertiary,\\nthe third part of your intelligence. It\\'s just that it\\'s ... Like the bandwidth, the rate of communication\\nwith that tertiary layer is slow. And it\\'s just a very tiny straw\\nto this tertiary layer. And we want to make that tiny\\nstraw a big highway. And I’m definitely not saying\\nthat this is going to solve everything. Or this is you know,\\nit’s the only thing -- it’s something that might be helpful. And worst-case scenario, I think we solve\\nsome important brain injury, spinal injury issues,\\nand that\\'s still a great outcome. CA: Best-case scenario, we may discover new\\nhuman possibility, telepathy, you\\'ve spoken of, in a way,\\na connection with a loved one, you know, full memory and much faster\\nthought processing maybe. All these things. It\\'s very cool. If AI were to take down Earth,\\nwe need a plan B. Let\\'s shift our attention to space. We spoke last time at TED\\nabout reusability, and you had just demonstrated that\\nspectacularly for the first time. Since then, you\\'ve gone on to build\\nthis monster rocket, Starship, which kind of changes the rules\\nof the game in spectacular ways. Tell us about Starship. EM: Starship is extremely fundamental. So the holy grail of rocketry\\nor space transport is full and rapid reusability. This has never been achieved. The closest that anything has come\\nis our Falcon 9 rocket, where we are able to recover\\nthe first stage, the boost stage, which is probably about 60 percent\\nof the cost of the vehicle of the whole launch, maybe 70 percent. And we\\'ve now done that\\nover a hundred times. So with Starship, we will be\\nrecovering the entire thing. Or at least that\\'s the goal. CA: Right. EM: And moreover,\\nrecovering it in such a way that it can be immediately re-flown. Whereas with Falcon 9, we still need\\nto do some amount of refurbishment to the booster and\\nto the fairing nose cone. But with Starship, the design goal\\nis immediate re-flight. So you just refill\\npropellants and go again. And this is gigantic. Just as it would be\\nin any other mode of transport. CA: And the main design is to basically take\\n100 plus people at a time, plus a bunch of things\\nthat they need, to Mars. So, first of all, talk about that piece. What is your latest timeline? One, for the first time,\\na Starship goes to Mars, presumably without people,\\nbut just equipment. Two, with people. Three, there’s sort of, OK, 100 people at a time, let\\'s go. EM: Sure. And just to put the cost\\nthing into perspective, the expected cost of Starship, putting 100 tons into orbit, is significantly less\\nthan what it would have cost or what it did cost to put our tiny\\nFalcon 1 rocket into orbit. Just as the cost of flying\\na 747 around the world is less than the cost of a small airplane. You know, a small airplane\\nthat was thrown away. So it\\'s really pretty mind-boggling\\nthat the giant thing costs less, way less than the small thing. So it doesn\\'t use exotic propellants or things that are difficult\\nto obtain on Mars. It uses methane as fuel, and it\\'s primarily oxygen,\\nroughly 77-78 percent oxygen by weight. And Mars has a CO2 atmosphere\\nand has water ice, which is CO2 plus H2O,\\nso you can make CH4, methane, and O2, oxygen, on Mars. CA: Presumably, one of the first tasks\\non Mars will be to create a fuel plant that can create the fuel\\nfor the return trips of many Starships. EM: Yes. And actually, it\\'s mostly\\ngoing to be oxygen plants, because it\\'s 78 percent oxygen,\\n22 percent fuel. But the fuel is a simple fuel\\nthat is easy to create on Mars. And in many other parts\\nof the solar system. So basically ... And it\\'s all propulsive landing,\\nno parachutes, nothing thrown away. It has a heat shield that’s capable\\nof entering on Earth or Mars. We can even potentially go to Venus. but you don\\'t want to go there. (Laughs) Venus is hell, almost literally. But you could ... It\\'s a generalized method of transport\\nto anywhere in the solar system, because the point at which\\nyou have propellant depo on Mars, you can then travel to the asteroid belt and to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and ultimately anywhere\\nin the solar system. CA: But your main focus and SpaceX\\'s main focus is still Mars. That is the mission. That is where most of the effort will go? Or are you actually imagining\\na much broader array of uses even in the coming, you know, the first decade or so of uses of this. Where we could go,\\nfor example, to other places in the solar system to explore, perhaps NASA wants to use\\nthe rocket for that reason. EM: Yeah, NASA is planning to use\\na Starship to return to the moon, to return people to the moon. And so we\\'re very honored that NASA\\nhas chosen us to do this. But I\\'m saying it is a generalized -- it’s a general solution to getting anywhere\\nin the greater solar system. It\\'s not suitable for going\\nto another star system, but it is a general solution for transport\\nanywhere in the solar system. CA: Before it can do any of that, it\\'s got to demonstrate it can get into\\norbit, you know, around Earth. What’s your latest advice\\non the timeline for that? EM: It\\'s looking promising for us\\nto have an orbital launch attempt in a few months. So we\\'re actually integrating -- will be integrating the engines\\ninto the booster for the first orbital flight\\nstarting in about a week or two. And the launch complex\\nitself is ready to go. So assuming we get regulatory approval, I think we could have an orbital\\nlaunch attempt within a few months. CA: And a radical new technology like this presumably there is real risk\\non those early attempts. EM: Oh, 100 percent, yeah. The joke I make all the time\\nis that excitement is guaranteed. Success is not guaranteed,\\nbut excitement certainly is. CA: But the last I saw on your timeline, you\\'ve slightly put back the expected date to put the first human on Mars\\ntill 2029, I want to say? EM: Yeah, I mean, so let\\'s see. I mean, we have built a production\\nsystem for Starship, so we\\'re making a lot\\nof ships and boosters. CA: How many are you planning\\nto make actually? EM: Well, we\\'re currently expecting\\nto make a booster and a ship roughly every, well, initially,\\nroughly every couple of months, and then hopefully by the end\\nof this year, one every month. So it\\'s giant rockets, and a lot of them. Just talking in terms\\nof rough orders of magnitude, in order to create\\na self-sustaining city on Mars, I think you will need something\\non the order of a thousand ships. And we just need a Helen of Sparta,\\nI guess, on Mars. CA: This is not in most\\npeople\\'s heads, Elon. EM: The planet that launched 1,000 ships. CA: That\\'s nice. But this is not in most people\\'s heads, this picture that you have in your mind. There\\'s basically a two-year window, you can only really fly to Mars\\nconveniently every two years. You were picturing that during the 2030s, every couple of years, something like 1,000 Starships take off, each containing 100 or more people. That picture is just completely\\nmind-blowing to me. That sense of this armada\\nof humans going to -- EM: It\\'ll be like \"Battlestar\\nGalactica,\" the fleet departs. CA: And you think that it can\\nbasically be funded by people spending maybe a couple hundred grand\\non a ticket to Mars? Is that price about where it has been? EM: Well, I think if you say like, what\\'s required in order to get\\nenough people and enough cargo to Mars to build a self-sustaining city. And it\\'s where you have an intersection of sets of people who want to go, because I think only a small percentage\\nof humanity will want to go, and can afford to go\\nor get sponsorship in some manner. That intersection of sets, I think, needs to be a million people\\nor something like that. And so it’s what can a million people\\nafford, or get sponsorship for, because I think governments\\nwill also pay for it, and people can take out loans. But I think at the point\\nat which you say, OK, like, if moving to Mars costs are,\\nfor argument’s sake, $100,000, then I think you know,\\nalmost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000\\nand be able to go to Mars if they want. We want to make it available\\nto anyone who wants to go. It\\'s very important to emphasize\\nthat Mars, especially in the beginning, will not be luxurious. It will be dangerous, cramped,\\ndifficult, hard work. It\\'s kind of like that Shackleton ad\\nfor going to the Antarctic, which I think is actually not real,\\nbut it sounds real and it\\'s cool. It\\'s sort of like, the sales pitch\\nfor going to Mars is, \"It\\'s dangerous, it\\'s cramped. You might not make it back. It\\'s difficult, it\\'s hard work.\" That\\'s the sales pitch. CA: Right. But you will make history. EM: But it\\'ll be glorious. CA: So on that kind of launch rate\\nyou\\'re talking about over two decades, you could get your million people\\nto Mars, essentially. Whose city is it? Is it NASA\\'s city, is it SpaceX\\'s city? EM: It’s the people of Mars’ city. The reason for this, I mean,\\nI feel like why do this thing? I think this is important for maximizing the probable lifespan of humanity\\nor consciousness. Human civilization could come\\nto an end for external reasons, like a giant meteor or super volcanoes\\nor extreme climate change. Or World War III, or you know,\\nany one of a number of reasons. But the probable life span\\nof civilizational consciousness as we know it, which we should really view\\nas this very delicate thing, like a small candle in a vast darkness. That is what appears to be the case. We\\'re in this vast darkness of space, and there\\'s this little\\ncandle of consciousness that’s only really come about\\nafter 4.5 billion years, and it could just go out. CA: I think that\\'s powerful, and I think a lot of people\\nwill be inspired by that vision. And the reason you need the million people is because there has to be\\nenough people there to do everything that you need to survive. EM: Really, like the critical threshold\\nis if the ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, does the Mars City die out or not? And so we have to -- You know, people talk about like,\\nthe sort of, the great filters, the things that perhaps, you know, we talk about the Fermi paradox,\\nand where are the aliens? Well maybe there are these\\nvarious great filters that the aliens didn’t pass, and so they eventually\\njust ceased to exist. And one of the great filters\\nis becoming a multi-planet species. So we want to pass that filter. And I\\'ll be long-dead before\\nthis is, you know, a real thing, before it happens. But I’d like to at least see us make\\ngreat progress in this direction. CA: Given how tortured\\nthe Earth is right now, how much we\\'re beating each other up, shouldn\\'t there be discussions going on with everyone who is dreaming\\nabout Mars to try to say, we\\'ve got a once\\nin a civilization\\'s chance to make some new rules here? Should someone be trying\\nto lead those discussions to figure out what it means for this\\nto be the people of Mars\\' City? EM: Well, I think ultimately this will be up to the people\\nof Mars to decide how they want to rethink society. Yeah there’s certainly risk there. And hopefully the people of Mars\\nwill be more enlightened and will not fight\\namongst each other too much. I mean, I have some recommendations, which people of Mars\\nmay choose to listen to or not. I would advocate for more\\nof a direct democracy, not a representative democracy, and laws that are short enough\\nfor people to understand. Where it is harder to create laws\\nthan to get rid of them. CA: Coming back a bit nearer term, I\\'d love you to just talk a bit\\nabout some of the other possibility space that Starship seems to have created. So given -- Suddenly we\\'ve got this ability\\nto move 100 tons-plus into orbit. So we\\'ve just launched\\nthe James Webb telescope, which is an incredible thing. It\\'s unbelievable. EM: Exquisite piece of technology. CA: Exquisite piece of technology. But people spent two years trying\\nto figure out how to fold up this thing. It\\'s a three-ton telescope. EM: We can make it a lot easier\\nif you’ve got more volume and mass. CA: But let\\'s ask a different question. Which is, how much more powerful\\na telescope could someone design based on using Starship, for example? EM: I mean, roughly, I\\'d say it\\'s probably\\nan order of magnitude more resolution. If you\\'ve got 100 tons\\nand a thousand cubic meters volume, which is roughly what we have. CA: And what about other exploration\\nthrough the solar system? I mean, I\\'m you know -- EM: Europa is a big question mark. CA: Right, so there\\'s an ocean there. And what you really want to do\\nis to drop a submarine into that ocean. EM: Maybe there\\'s like,\\nsome squid civilization, cephalopod civilization\\nunder the ice of Europa. That would be pretty interesting. CA: I mean, Elon, if you could take\\na submarine to Europa and we see pictures of this thing\\nbeing devoured by a squid, that would honestly be\\nthe happiest moment of my life. EM: Pretty wild, yeah. CA: What other possibilities\\nare out there? Like, it feels like if you\\'re going to\\ncreate a thousand of these things, they can only fly to Mars every two years. What are they doing the rest of the time? It feels like there\\'s this\\nexplosion of possibility that I don\\'t think people\\nare really thinking about. EM: I don\\'t know, we\\'ve certainly\\ngot a long way to go. As you alluded to earlier,\\nwe still have to get to orbit. And then after we get to orbit, we have to really prove out and refine\\nfull and rapid reusability. That\\'ll take a moment. But I do think we will solve this. I\\'m highly confident\\nwe will solve this at this point. CA: Do you ever wake up with the fear that there\\'s going to be this\\nHindenburg moment for SpaceX where ... EM: We\\'ve had many Hindenburg. Well, we\\'ve never had Hindenburg moments\\nwith people, which is very important. Big difference. We\\'ve blown up quite a few rockets. So there\\'s a whole compilation online\\nthat we put together and others put together, it\\'s showing rockets are hard. I mean, the sheer amount of energy\\ngoing through a rocket boggles the mind. So, you know, getting out\\nof Earth\\'s gravity well is difficult. We have a strong gravity\\nand a thick atmosphere. And Mars, which is less than 40 percent, it\\'s like, 37 percent of Earth\\'s gravity and has a thin atmosphere. The ship alone can go all the way from the surface of Mars\\nto the surface of Earth. Whereas getting to Mars requires\\na giant booster and orbital refilling. CA: So, Elon, as I think more\\nabout this incredible array of things that you\\'re involved with, I keep seeing these synergies, to use a horrible word, between them. You know, for example, the robots you\\'re building from Tesla\\ncould possibly be pretty handy on Mars, doing some of the dangerous\\nwork and so forth. I mean, maybe there\\'s a scenario\\nwhere your city on Mars doesn\\'t need a million people, it needs half a million people\\nand half a million robots. And that\\'s a possibility. Maybe The Boring Company could play a role helping create some of the subterranean\\ndwelling spaces that you might need. EM: Yeah. CA: Back on planet Earth, it seems like a partnership\\nbetween Boring Company and Tesla could offer an unbelievable deal to a city to say, we will create for you\\na 3D network of tunnels populated by robo-taxis that will offer fast, low-cost\\ntransport to anyone. You know, full self-driving may\\nor may not be done this year. And in some cities,\\nlike, somewhere like Mumbai, I suspect won\\'t be done for a decade. EM: Some places are more\\nchallenging than others. CA: But today, today,\\nwith what you\\'ve got, you could put a 3D network\\nof tunnels under there. EM: Oh, if it’s just in a tunnel,\\nthat’s a solved problem. CA: Exactly, full self-driving\\nis a solved problem. To me, there’s amazing synergy there. With Starship, you know, Gwynne Shotwell talked\\nabout by 2028 having from city to city, you know, transport on planet Earth. EM: This is a real possibility. The fastest way to get\\nfrom one place to another, if it\\'s a long distance, is a rocket. It\\'s basically an ICBM. CA: But it has to land -- Because it\\'s an ICBM,\\nit has to land probably offshore, because it\\'s loud. So why not have a tunnel\\nthat then connects to the city with Tesla? And Neuralink. I mean, if you going to go to Mars having a telepathic connection\\nwith loved ones back home, even if there\\'s a time delay... EM: These are not intended\\nto be connected, by the way. But there certainly could be\\nsome synergies, yeah. CA: Surely there is a growing argument that you should actually put\\nall these things together into one company and just have a company\\ndevoted to creating a future that’s exciting, and let a thousand flowers bloom. Have you been thinking about that? EM: I mean, it is tricky because Tesla\\nis a publicly-traded company, and the investor base of Tesla and SpaceX and certainly Boring Company\\nand Neuralink are quite different. Boring Company and Neuralink\\nare tiny companies. CA: By comparison. EM: Yeah, Tesla\\'s got 110,000 people. SpaceX I think is around 12,000 people. Boring Company and Neuralink\\nare both under 200 people. So they\\'re little, tiny companies, but they will probably\\nget bigger in the future. They will get bigger in the future. It\\'s not that easy to sort\\nof combine these things. CA: Traditionally, you have said\\nthat for SpaceX especially, you wouldn\\'t want it public, because public investors wouldn\\'t support\\nthe craziness of the idea of going to Mars or whatever. EM: Yeah, making life multi-planetary is outside of the normal time horizon\\nof Wall Street analysts. (Laughs) To say the least. CA: I think something\\'s changed, though. What\\'s changed is that Tesla is now\\nso powerful and so big and throws off so much cash that you actually could\\nconnect the dots here. Just tell the public that x-billion\\ndollars a year, whatever your number is, will be diverted to the Mars mission. I suspect you\\'d have massive\\ninterest in that company. And it might unlock a lot\\nmore possibility for you, no? EM: I would like to give the public access\\nto ownership of SpaceX, but I mean the thing that like, the overhead associated\\nwith a public company is high. I mean, as a public company,\\nyou\\'re just constantly sued. It does occupy like, a fair bit of ... You know, time and effort\\nto deal with these things. CA: But you would still only have one\\npublic company, it would be bigger, and have more things going on. But instead of being\\non four boards, you\\'d be on one. EM: I\\'m actually not even on the Neuralink\\nor Boring Company boards. And I don\\'t really attend\\nthe SpaceX board meetings. We only have two a year, and I just stop by and chat for an hour. The board overhead for a public\\ncompany is much higher. CA: I think some investors probably worry\\nabout how your time is being split, and they might be excited\\nby you know, that. Anyway, I just woke up the other day thinking, just, there are so many ways\\nin which these things connect. And you know,\\njust the simplicity of that mission, of building a future that is worth\\ngetting excited about, might appeal to an awful lot of people. Elon, you are reported by Forbes\\nand everyone else as now, you know, the world\\'s richest person. EM: That’s not a sovereign. CA: (Laughs) EM: You know, I think it’s fair to say that if somebody is like, the king\\nor de facto king of a country, they\\'re wealthier than I am. CA: But it’s just harder to measure -- So $300 billion. I mean, your net worth on any given day is rising or falling\\nby several billion dollars. How insane is that? EM: It\\'s bonkers, yeah. CA: I mean, how do you handle\\nthat psychologically? There aren\\'t many people in the world\\nwho have to even think about that. EM: I actually don\\'t think\\nabout that too much. But the thing that is\\nactually more difficult and that does make sleeping difficult is that, you know, every good hour or even minute of thinking about Tesla and SpaceX has such a big effect on the company that I really try to work\\nas much as possible, you know, to the edge\\nof sanity, basically. Because you know,\\nTesla’s getting to the point where probably will get\\nto the point later this year, where every high-quality\\nminute of thinking is a million dollars impact on Tesla. Which is insane. I mean, the basic, you know,\\nif Tesla is doing, you know, sort of $2 billion a week,\\nlet’s say, in revenue, it’s sort of $300 million a day,\\nseven days a week. You know, it\\'s ... CA: If you can change that by five percent\\nin an hour’s brainstorm, that\\'s a pretty valuable hour. EM: I mean, there are many instances\\nwhere a half-hour meeting, I was able to improve\\nthe financial outcome of the company by $100 million\\nin a half-hour meeting. CA: There are many other people out there who can\\'t stand\\nthis world of billionaires. Like, they are hugely\\noffended by the notion that an individual can have\\nthe same wealth as, say, a billion or more\\nof the world\\'s poorest people. EM: If they examine sort of -- I think there\\'s some axiomatic flaws\\nthat are leading them to that conclusion. For sure, it would be very\\nproblematic if I was consuming, you know, billions of dollars a year\\nin personal consumption. But that is not the case. In fact, I don\\'t even own\\na home right now. I\\'m literally staying at friends\\' places. If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most\\nof Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through\\nfriends\\' spare bedrooms. I don\\'t have a yacht,\\nI really don\\'t take vacations. It’s not as though my personal\\nconsumption is high. I mean, the one exception is a plane. But if I don\\'t use the plane,\\nthen I have less hours to work. CA: I mean, I personally think\\nyou have shown that you are mostly driven by really quite a deep\\nsense of moral purpose. Like, your attempts to solve\\nthe climate problem have been as powerful as anyone else\\non the planet that I\\'m aware of. And I actually can\\'t understand, personally, I can\\'t understand the fact that you get all this criticism\\nfrom the Left about, \"Oh, my God, he\\'s so rich,\\nthat\\'s disgusting.\" When climate is their issue. Philanthropy is a topic\\nthat some people go to. Philanthropy is a hard topic. How do you think about that? EM: I think if you care\\nabout the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it,\\nphilanthropy is extremely difficult. SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink\\nand The Boring Company are philanthropy. If you say philanthropy\\nis love of humanity, they are philanthropy. Tesla is accelerating sustainable energy. This is a love -- philanthropy. SpaceX is trying to ensure\\nthe long-term survival of humanity with a multiple-planet species. That is love of humanity. You know, Neuralink is trying to help\\nsolve brain injuries and existential risk with AI. Love of humanity. Boring Company is trying to solve traffic,\\nwhich is hell for most people, and that also is love of humanity. CA: How upsetting is it to you to hear this constant drumbeat of, \"Billionaires, my God,\\nElon Musk, oh, my God?\" Like, do you just shrug that off or does it does it actually hurt? EM: I mean, at this point,\\nit\\'s water off a duck\\'s back. CA: Elon, I’d like to,\\nas we wrap up now, just pull the camera back\\nand just think ... You’re a father now\\nof seven surviving kids. EM: Well, I mean, I\\'m trying\\nto set a good example because the birthrate on Earth is so low that we\\'re facing civilizational collapse unless the birth rate returns\\nto a sustainable level. CA: Yeah, you\\'ve talked about this a lot, that depopulation is a big problem, and people don\\'t understand\\nhow big a problem it is. EM: Population collapse\\nis one of the biggest threats to the future of human civilization. And that is what is going on right now. CA: What drives you on a day-to-day\\nbasis to do what you do? EM: I guess, like,\\nI really want to make sure that there is a good future for humanity and that we\\'re on a path to understanding\\nthe nature of the universe, the meaning of life. Why are we here, how did we get here? And in order to understand\\nthe nature of the universe and all these fundamental questions, we must expand the scope\\nand scale of consciousness. Certainly it must not diminish or go out. Or we certainly won’t understand this. I would say I’ve been motivated\\nby curiosity more than anything, and just desire to think about the future and not be sad, you know? CA: And are you? Are you not sad? EM: I\\'m sometimes sad, but mostly I\\'m feeling I guess relatively optimistic\\nabout the future these days. There are certainly some big\\nrisks that humanity faces. I think the population collapse\\nis a really big deal, that I wish more people would think about because the birth rate is far below\\nwhat\\'s needed to sustain civilization at its current level. And there\\'s obviously ... We need to take action\\non climate sustainability, which is being done. And we need to secure\\nthe future of consciousness by being a multi-planet species. We need to address -- Essentially, it\\'s important to take\\nwhatever actions we can think of to address the existential risks\\nthat affect the future of consciousness. CA: There\\'s a whole\\ngeneration coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think if you want the future\\nto be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good. And it will be. CA: Elon, thank you for all this time. That is a beautiful place to end. Thanks for all you\\'re doing.

CA: We\\'re here at the Texas Gigafactory\\nthe day before this thing opens. It\\'s been pretty crazy out there. Thank you so much\\nfor making time on a busy day. I would love you to help us,\\nkind of, cast our minds, I don\\'t know, 10, 20,\\n30 years into the future. And help us try to picture\\nwhat it would take to build a future that\\'s worth\\ngetting excited about. The last time you spoke at TED, you said that that was really\\njust a big driver. You know, you can talk about lots of other\\nreasons to do the work you\\'re doing, but fundamentally, you want\\nto think about the future and not think that it sucks. EM: Yeah, absolutely. I think in general, you know, there\\'s a lot of discussion of like,\\nthis problem or that problem. And a lot of people are sad\\nabout the future and they\\'re ... Pessimistic. And I think ... this is ... This is not great. I mean, we really want\\nto wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited\\nabout what\\'s going to happen. And life cannot simply be about sort of, solving one miserable\\nproblem after another. CA: So if you look forward 30 years,\\nyou know, the year 2050 has been labeled by scientists as this, kind of, almost like this\\ndoomsday deadline on climate. There\\'s a consensus of scientists,\\na large consensus of scientists, who believe that if we haven\\'t\\ncompletely eliminated greenhouse gases or offset them completely by 2050, effectively we\\'re inviting\\nclimate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway\\nto avoid that catastrophe? And what would it look like? EM: Yeah, so I am not one\\nof the doomsday people, which may surprise you. I actually think we\\'re on a good path. But at the same time, I want to caution against complacency. So, so long as we are not complacent, as long as we have a high sense of urgency about moving towards\\na sustainable energy economy, then I think things will be fine. So I can\\'t emphasize that enough, as long as we push hard\\nand are not complacent, the future is going to be great. Don\\'t worry about it. I mean, worry about it, but if you worry about it, ironically,\\nit will be a self-unfulfilling prophecy. So, like, there are three elements\\nto a sustainable energy future. One is of sustainable energy generation,\\nwhich is primarily wind and solar. There\\'s also hydro, geothermal, I\\'m actually pro-nuclear. I think nuclear is fine. But it\\'s going to be primarily\\nsolar and wind, as the primary generators of energy. The second part is you need batteries\\nto store the solar and wind energy because the sun\\ndoesn\\'t shine all the time, the wind doesn\\'t blow all the time. So it\\'s a lot of stationary battery packs. And then you need electric transport. So electric cars, electric planes, boats. And then ultimately, it’s not really possible\\nto make electric rockets, but you can make\\nthe propellant used in rockets using sustainable energy. So ultimately, we can have a fully\\nsustainable energy economy. And it\\'s those three things: solar/wind, stationary\\nbattery pack, electric vehicles. So then what are the limiting\\nfactors on progress? The limiting factor really will be\\nbattery cell production. So that\\'s going to really be\\nthe fundamental rate driver. And then whatever the slowest element of the whole lithium-ion\\nbattery cells supply chain, from mining and the many steps of refining to ultimately creating a battery cell and putting it into a pack, that will be the limiting factor\\non progress towards sustainability. CA: All right, so we need to talk\\nmore about batteries, because the key thing\\nthat I want to understand, like, there seems to be\\na scaling issue here that is kind of amazing and alarming. You have said that you have calculated that the amount of battery production\\nthat the world needs for sustainability is 300 terawatt hours of batteries. That\\'s the end goal? EM: Very rough numbers, and I certainly would invite others\\nto check our calculations because they may arrive\\nat different conclusions. But in order to transition, not just\\ncurrent electricity production, but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the amount\\nof electricity that you need, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt\\nhours of installed capacity. CA: So we need to give people\\na sense of how big a task that is. I mean, here we are at the Gigafactory. You know, this is one of the biggest\\nbuildings in the world. What I\\'ve read, and tell me\\nif this is still right, is that the goal here is to eventually\\nproduce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here a year eventually. EM: We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully we get there\\nwithin a couple of years. CA: Right. But I mean, that is one -- EM: 0.1 terrawat hours. CA: But that\\'s still 1/100\\nof what\\'s needed. How much of the rest of that 100\\nis Tesla planning to take on let\\'s say, between now and 2030, 2040, when we really need to see\\nthe scale up happen? EM: I mean, these are just guesses. So please, people shouldn\\'t\\nhold me to these things. It\\'s not like this is like some -- What tends to happen\\nis I\\'ll make some like, you know, best guess and then people, in five years, there’ll be some jerk\\nthat writes an article: \"Elon said this would happen,\\nand it didn\\'t happen. He\\'s a liar and a fool.\" It\\'s very annoying when that happens. So these are just guesses,\\nthis is a conversation. CA: Right. EM: I think Tesla probably ends up\\ndoing 10 percent of that. Roughly. CA: Let\\'s say 2050 we have this amazing, you know,\\n100 percent sustainable electric grid made up of, you know, some mixture\\nof the sustainable energy sources you talked about. That same grid probably\\nis offering the world really low-cost energy, isn\\'t it, compared with now. And I\\'m curious about like, are people entitled to get\\na little bit excited about the possibilities of that world? EM: People should be optimistic\\nabout the future. Humanity will solve sustainable energy. It will happen if we, you know,\\ncontinue to push hard, the future is bright and good\\nfrom an energy standpoint. And then it will be possible to also use\\nthat energy to do carbon sequestration. It takes a lot of energy to pull\\ncarbon out of the atmosphere because in putting it in the atmosphere\\nit releases energy. So now, you know, obviously\\nin order to pull it out, you need to use a lot of energy. But if you\\'ve got a lot of sustainable\\nenergy from wind and solar, you can actually sequester carbon. So you can reverse the CO2 parts\\nper million of the atmosphere and oceans. And also you can really have\\nas much fresh water as you want. Earth is mostly water. We should call Earth “Water.” It\\'s 70 percent water by surface area. Now most of that’s seawater, but it\\'s like we just happen to be\\non the bit that\\'s land. CA: And with energy,\\nyou can turn seawater into -- EM: Yes. CA: Irrigating water\\nor whatever water you need. EM: At very low cost. Things will be good. CA: Things will be good. And also, there\\'s other benefits\\nto this non-fossil fuel world where the air is cleaner -- EM: Yes, exactly. Because, like, when you burn fossil fuels, there\\'s all these side reactions and toxic gases of various kinds. And sort of little particulates\\nthat are bad for your lungs. Like, there\\'s all sorts\\nof bad things that are happening that will go away. And the sky will be cleaner and quieter. The future\\'s going to be good. CA: I want us to switch now to think\\na bit about artificial intelligence. But the segue there, you mentioned how annoying it is\\nwhen people call you up for bad predictions in the past. So I\\'m possibly going to be annoying now, but I’m curious about your timelines\\nand how you predict and how come some things are so amazingly\\non the money and some aren\\'t. So when it comes to predicting sales\\nof Tesla vehicles, for example, you\\'ve kind of been amazing, I think in 2014 when Tesla\\nhad sold that year 60,000 cars, you said, \"2020, I think we will do\\nhalf a million a year.\" EM: Yeah, we did\\nalmost exactly a half million. CA: You did almost exactly half a million. You were scoffed in 2014\\nbecause no one since Henry Ford, with the Model T, had come close\\nto that kind of growth rate for cars. You were scoffed, and you actually\\nhit 500,000 cars and then 510,000 or whatever produced. But five years ago,\\nlast time you came to TED, I asked you about full self-driving, and you said, “Yeah, this very year, I\\'m confident that we will have a car\\ngoing from LA to New York without any intervention.\" EM: Yeah, I don\\'t want to blow your mind,\\nbut I\\'m not always right. CA: (Laughs) What\\'s the difference between those two? Why has full self-driving in particular\\nbeen so hard to predict? EM: I mean, the thing that really got me, and I think it\\'s going to get\\na lot of other people, is that there are just so many\\nfalse dawns with self-driving, where you think you\\'ve got the problem, have a handle on the problem, and then it, no, turns out\\nyou just hit a ceiling. Because if you were to plot the progress, the progress looks like a log curve. So it\\'s like a series of log curves. So most people don\\'t know\\nwhat a log curve is, I suppose. CA: Show the shape with your hands. EM: It goes up you know,\\nsort of a fairly straight way, and then it starts tailing off and you start getting diminishing returns. And you\\'re like, uh oh, it was trending up and now\\nit\\'s sort of, curving over and you start getting to these,\\nwhat I call local maxima, where you don\\'t realize\\nbasically how dumb you were. And then it happens again. And ultimately... These things, you know,\\nin retrospect, they seem obvious, but in order to solve\\nfull self-driving properly, you actually have to solve real-world AI. Because what are the road networks\\ndesigned to work with? They\\'re designed to work\\nwith a biological neural net, our brains, and with vision, our eyes. And so in order to make it\\nwork with computers, you basically need to solve\\nreal-world AI and vision. Because we need cameras and silicon neural nets in order to have self-driving work for a system that was designed\\nfor eyes and biological neural nets. You know, I guess\\nwhen you put it that way, it\\'s sort of, like, quite obvious that the only way\\nto solve full self-driving is to solve real world AI\\nand sophisticated vision. CA: What do you feel\\nabout the current architecture? Do you think you have an architecture now where there is a chance for the logarithmic curve\\nnot to tail off any anytime soon? EM: Well I mean, admittedly\\nthese may be infamous last words, but I actually am confident\\nthat we will solve it this year. That we will exceed -- The probability of an accident, at what point do you exceed\\nthat of the average person? I think we will exceed that this year. CA: What are you seeing behind the scenes\\nthat gives you that confidence? EM: We’re almost at the point\\nwhere we have a high-quality unified vector space. In the beginning, we were trying\\nto do this with image recognition on individual images. But if you get one image out of a video, it\\'s actually quite hard to see\\nwhat\\'s going on without ambiguity. But if you look at a video segment\\nof a few seconds of video, that ambiguity resolves. So the first thing we had to do\\nis tie all eight cameras together so they\\'re synchronized, so that all the frames\\nare looked at simultaneously and labeled simultaneously by one person, because we still need human labeling. So at least they’re not labeled\\nat different times by different people in different ways. So it\\'s sort of a surround picture. Then a very important part\\nis to add the time dimension. So that you’re looking at surround video, and you\\'re labeling surround video. And this is actually quite difficult to do\\nfrom a software standpoint. We had to write our own labeling tools and then create auto labeling, create auto labeling software to amplify\\nthe efficiency of human labelers because it’s quite hard to label. In the beginning,\\nit was taking several hours to label a 10-second video clip. This is not scalable. So basically what you have to have\\nis you have to have surround video, and that surround video has to be\\nprimarily automatically labeled with humans just being editors and making slight corrections\\nto the labeling of the video and then feeding back those corrections\\ninto the future auto labeler, so you get this flywheel eventually where the auto labeler\\nis able to take in vast amounts of video and with high accuracy, automatically label the video\\nfor cars, lane lines, drive space. CA: What you’re saying is ... the result of this is that you\\'re\\neffectively giving the car a 3D model of the actual objects\\nthat are all around it. It knows what they are, and it knows how fast they are moving. And the remaining task is to predict what the quirky behaviors are\\nthat, you know, that when a pedestrian is walking\\ndown the road with a smaller pedestrian, that maybe that smaller pedestrian\\nmight do something unpredictable or things like that. You have to build into it\\nbefore you can really call it safe. EM: You basically need to have\\nmemory across time and space. So what I mean by that is ... Memory can’t be infinite, because it\\'s using up a lot\\nof the computer\\'s RAM basically. So you have to say how much\\nare you going to try to remember? It\\'s very common\\nfor things to be occluded. So if you talk about say,\\na pedestrian walking past a truck where you saw the pedestrian start\\non one side of the truck, then they\\'re occluded by the truck. You would know intuitively, OK, that pedestrian is going to pop out\\nthe other side, most likely. CA: A computer doesn\\'t know it. EM: You need to slow down. CA: A skeptic is going to say\\nthat every year for the last five years, you\\'ve kind of said, well, no this is the year, we\\'re confident that it will be there\\nin a year or two or, you know, like it\\'s always been about that far away. But we\\'ve got a new architecture now, you\\'re seeing enough improvement\\nbehind the scenes to make you not certain,\\nbut pretty confident, that, by the end of this year, what in most, not in every city,\\nand every circumstance but in many cities and circumstances, basically the car will be able\\nto drive without interventions safer than a human. EM: Yes. I mean, the car currently\\ndrives me around Austin most of the time with no interventions. So it\\'s not like ... And we have over 100,000 people in our full self-driving beta program. So you can look at the videos\\nthat they post online. CA: I do. And some of them are great,\\nand some of them are a little terrifying. I mean, occasionally\\nthe car seems to veer off and scare the hell out of people. EM: It’s still a beta. CA: But you’re behind the scenes,\\nlooking at the data, you\\'re seeing enough improvement to believe that a this-year\\ntimeline is real. EM: Yes, that\\'s what it seems like. I mean, we could be here\\ntalking again in a year, like, well, another year went by,\\nand it didn’t happen. But I think this is the year. CA: And so in general,\\nwhen people talk about Elon time, I mean it sounds like\\nyou can\\'t just have a general rule that if you predict that something\\nwill be done in six months, actually what we should imagine\\nis it’s going to be a year or it’s like two-x or three-x,\\nit depends on the type of prediction. Some things, I guess,\\nthings involving software, AI, whatever, are fundamentally harder\\nto predict than others. Is there an element that you actually deliberately make\\naggressive prediction timelines to drive people to be ambitious? Without that, nothing gets done? EM: Well, I generally believe,\\nin terms of internal timelines, that we want to set the most aggressive\\ntimeline that we can. Because there’s sort of like\\na law of gaseous expansion where, for schedules, where\\nwhatever time you set, it\\'s not going to be less than that. It\\'s very rare\\nthat it\\'ll be less than that. But as far as our predictions\\nare concerned, what tends to happen in the media is that they will report\\nall the wrong ones and ignore all the right ones. Or, you know, when writing\\nan article about me -- I\\'ve had a long career\\nin multiple industries. If you list my sins, I sound\\nlike the worst person on Earth. But if you put those\\nagainst the things I\\'ve done right, it makes much more sense, you know? So essentially like,\\nthe longer you do anything, the more mistakes\\nthat you will make cumulatively. Which, if you sum up those mistakes, will sound like I\\'m the worst\\npredictor ever. But for example, for Tesla vehicle growth, I said I think we’d do 50 percent,\\nand we’ve done 80 percent. CA: Yes. EM: But they don\\'t mention that one. So, I mean, I\\'m not sure what my exact\\ntrack record is on predictions. They\\'re more optimistic than pessimistic,\\nbut they\\'re not all optimistic. Some of them are exceeded\\nprobably more or later, but they do come true. It\\'s very rare that they do not come true. It\\'s sort of like, you know, if there\\'s some radical\\ntechnology prediction, the point is not\\nthat it was a few years late, but that it happened at all. That\\'s the more important part. CA: So it feels like\\nat some point in the last year, seeing the progress on understanding, the Tesla AI understanding\\nthe world around it, led to a kind of, an aha moment at Tesla. Because you really surprised people\\nrecently when you said probably the most important\\nproduct development going on at Tesla this year\\nis this robot, Optimus. EM: Yes. CA: Many companies out there\\nhave tried to put out these robots, they\\'ve been working on them for years. And so far no one has really cracked it. There\\'s no mass adoption\\nrobot in people\\'s homes. There are some in manufacturing,\\nbut I would say, no one\\'s kind of, really cracked it. Is it something that happened in the development of full self-driving\\nthat gave you the confidence to say, \"You know what, we could do\\nsomething special here.\" EM: Yeah, exactly. So, you know, it took me a while\\nto sort of realize that in order to solve self-driving, you really needed to solve real-world AI. And at the point of which you solve\\nreal-world AI for a car, which is really a robot on four wheels, you can then generalize that\\nto a robot on legs as well. The two hard parts I think -- like obviously companies\\nlike Boston Dynamics have shown that it\\'s possible\\nto make quite compelling, sometimes alarming robots. CA: Right. EM: You know, so from a sensors\\nand actuators standpoint, it\\'s certainly been demonstrated by many that it\\'s possible to make\\na humanoid robot. The things that are currently missing\\nare enough intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world\\nand do useful things without being explicitly instructed. So the missing things are basically\\nreal-world intelligence and scaling up manufacturing. Those are two things\\nthat Tesla is very good at. And so then we basically just need\\nto design the specialized actuators and sensors that are needed\\nfor humanoid robot. People have no idea,\\nthis is going to be bigger than the car. CA: So let\\'s dig into exactly that. I mean, in one way, it\\'s actually\\nan easier problem than full self-driving because instead of an object\\ngoing along at 60 miles an hour, which if it gets it wrong,\\nsomeone will die. This is an object that\\'s engineered\\nto only go at what, three or four or five miles an hour. And so a mistake,\\nthere aren\\'t lives at stake. There might be embarrassment at stake. EM: So long as the AI doesn\\'t take it over\\nand murder us in our sleep or something. CA: Right. (Laughter) So talk about -- I think the first applications\\nyou\\'ve mentioned are probably going to be manufacturing, but eventually the vision is to have\\nthese available for people at home. If you had a robot that really understood\\nthe 3D architecture of your house and knew where every object\\nin that house was or was supposed to be, and could recognize all those objects, I mean, that’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? Like the kind of thing\\nthat you could ask a robot to do would be what? Like, tidy up? EM: Yeah, absolutely. Make dinner, I guess, mow the lawn. CA: Take a cup of tea to grandma\\nand show her family pictures. EM: Exactly. Take care\\nof my grandmother and make sure -- CA: It could obviously recognize\\neveryone in the home. It could play catch with your kids. EM: Yes. I mean, obviously,\\nwe need to be careful this doesn\\'t become a dystopian situation. I think one of the things\\nthat\\'s going to be important is to have a localized\\nROM chip on the robot that cannot be updated over the air. Where if you, for example, were to say,\\n“Stop, stop, stop,” if anyone said that, then the robot would stop,\\nyou know, type of thing. And that\\'s not updatable remotely. I think it\\'s going to be important\\nto have safety features like that. CA: Yeah, that sounds wise. EM: And I do think there should be\\na regulatory agency for AI. I\\'ve said that for many years. I don\\'t love being regulated, but I think this is an important\\nthing for public safety. CA: Let\\'s come back to that. But I don\\'t think many people\\nhave really sort of taken seriously the notion of, you know, a robot at home. I mean, at the start\\nof the computing revolution, Bill Gates said there\\'s going to be\\na computer in every home. And people at the time said, yeah,\\nwhatever, who would even want that. Do you think there will be basically\\nlike in, say, 2050 or whatever, like a robot in most homes,\\nis what there will be, and people will love them\\nand count on them? You’ll have your own butler basically. EM: Yeah, you\\'ll have your sort of\\nbuddy robot probably, yeah. CA: I mean, how much of a buddy? How many applications have you thought, you know, can you have\\na romantic partner, a sex partner? EM: It\\'s probably inevitable. I mean, I did promise the internet\\nthat I’d make catgirls. We could make a robot catgirl. CA: Be careful what\\nyou promise the internet. (Laughter) EM: So, yeah, I guess it\\'ll be\\nwhatever people want really, you know. CA: What sort of timeline\\nshould we be thinking about of the first models\\nthat are actually made and sold? EM: Well, you know, the first units\\nthat we intend to make are for jobs that are dangerous,\\nboring, repetitive, and things that people don\\'t want to do. And, you know, I think we’ll have like\\nan interesting prototype sometime this year. We might have something useful next year, but I think quite likely\\nwithin at least two years. And then we\\'ll see\\nrapid growth year over year of the usefulness\\nof the humanoid robots and decrease in cost\\nand scaling up production. CA: Initially just selling to businesses, or when do you picture\\nyou\\'ll start selling them where you can buy your parents one\\nfor Christmas or something? EM: I\\'d say in less than ten years. CA: Help me on the economics of this. So what do you picture the cost\\nof one of these being? EM: Well, I think the cost is actually\\nnot going to be crazy high. Like less than a car. Initially, things will be expensive\\nbecause it\\'ll be a new technology at low production volume. The complexity and cost of a car\\nis greater than that of a humanoid robot. So I would expect that it\\'s going\\nto be less than a car, or at least equivalent to a cheap car. CA: So even if it starts at 50k,\\nwithin a few years, it’s down to 20k or lower or whatever. And maybe for home\\nthey\\'ll get much cheaper still. But think about the economics of this. If you can replace a $30,000, $40,000-a-year worker, which you have to pay every year, with a one-time payment of $25,000 for a robot that can work longer hours, a pretty rapid replacement\\nof certain types of jobs. How worried should\\nthe world be about that? EM: I wouldn\\'t worry about the sort of,\\nputting people out of a job thing. I think we\\'re actually going to have,\\nand already do have, a massive shortage of labor. So I think we will have ... Not people out of work, but actually still a shortage\\nlabor even in the future. But this really will be\\na world of abundance. Any goods and services will be available\\nto anyone who wants them. It\\'ll be so cheap to have goods\\nand services, it will be ridiculous. CA: I\\'m presuming it should be possible\\nto imagine a bunch of goods and services that can\\'t profitably be made now\\nbut could be made in that world, courtesy of legions of robots. EM: Yeah. It will be a world of abundance. The only scarcity\\nthat will exist in the future is that which we decide to create\\nourselves as humans. CA: OK. So AI is allowing us to imagine\\na differently powered economy that will create this abundance. What are you most worried\\nabout going wrong? EM: Well, like I said,\\nAI and robotics will bring out what might be termed the age of abundance. Other people have used this word, and that this is my prediction: it will be an age of abundance \\nfor everyone. But I guess there’s ... The dangers would be\\nthe artificial general intelligence or digital superintelligence decouples\\nfrom a collective human will and goes in the direction\\nthat for some reason we don\\'t like. Whatever direction it might go. You know, that’s sort of\\nthe idea behind Neuralink, is to try to more tightly couple\\ncollective human world to digital superintelligence. And also along the way solve a lot\\nof brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing. So even if it doesn\\'t succeed\\nin the greater goal, I think it will succeed in the goal\\nof alleviating brain and spine damage. CA: So the spirit there is\\nthat if we\\'re going to make these AIs that are so vastly intelligent,\\nwe ought to be wired directly to them so that we ourselves can have\\nthose superpowers more directly. But that doesn\\'t seem to avoid\\nthe risk that those superpowers might ... turn ugly in unintended ways. EM: I think it\\'s a risk, I agree. I\\'m not saying that I have\\nsome certain answer to that risk. I’m just saying like maybe one of the things\\nthat would be good for ensuring that the future\\nis one that we want is to more tightly couple the collective human world\\nto digital intelligence. The issue that we face here\\nis that we are already a cyborg, if you think about it. The computers are\\nan extension of ourselves. And when we die, we have,\\nlike, a digital ghost. You know, all of our text messages\\nand social media, emails. And it\\'s quite eerie actually, when someone dies but everything\\nonline is still there. But you say like, what\\'s the limitation? What is it that inhibits\\na human-machine symbiosis? It\\'s the data rate. When you communicate,\\nespecially with a phone, you\\'re moving your thumbs very slowly. So you\\'re like moving\\nyour two little meat sticks at a rate that’s maybe 10 bits per second,\\noptimistically, 100 bits per second. And computers are communicating\\nat the gigabyte level and beyond. CA: Have you seen evidence\\nthat the technology is actually working, that you\\'ve got a richer, sort of,\\nhigher bandwidth connection, if you like, between like external\\nelectronics and a brain than has been possible before? EM: Yeah. I mean, the fundamental principles\\nof reading neurons, sort of doing read-write on neurons\\nwith tiny electrodes, have been demonstrated for decades. So it\\'s not like the concept is new. The problem is that there is\\nno product that works well that you can go and buy. So it\\'s all sort of, in research labs. And it\\'s like some cords\\nsticking out of your head. And it\\'s quite gruesome,\\nand it\\'s really ... There\\'s no good product\\nthat actually does a good job and is high-bandwidth and safe and something actually that you could buy\\nand would want to buy. But the way to think\\nof the Neuralink device is kind of like a Fitbit\\nor an Apple Watch. That\\'s where we take out\\nsort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter, replace that with what, in many ways really is very much like\\na Fitbit, Apple Watch or some kind of smart watch thing. But with tiny, tiny wires, very, very tiny wires. Wires so tiny, it’s hard to even see them. And it\\'s very important\\nto have very tiny wires so that when they’re implanted,\\nthey don’t damage the brain. CA: How far are you from putting\\nthese into humans? EM: Well, we have put in\\nour FDA application to aspirationally do the first\\nhuman implant this year. CA: The first uses will be\\nfor neurological injuries of different kinds. But rolling the clock forward and imagining when people\\nare actually using these for their own enhancement, let\\'s say, and for the enhancement of the world, how clear are you in your mind as to what it will feel like\\nto have one of these inside your head? EM: Well, I do want to emphasize\\nwe\\'re at an early stage. And so it really will be\\nmany years before we have anything approximating\\na high-bandwidth neural interface that allows for AI-human symbiosis. For many years, we will just be solving\\nbrain injuries and spinal injuries. For probably a decade. This is not something\\nthat will suddenly one day it will have this incredible\\nsort of whole brain interface. It\\'s going to be, like I said, at least a decade of really\\njust solving brain injuries and spinal injuries. And really, I think you can solve\\na very wide range of brain injuries, including severe depression,\\nmorbid obesity, sleep, potentially schizophrenia, like, a lot of things that cause\\ngreat stress to people. Restoring memory in older people. CA: If you can pull that off,\\nthat\\'s the app I will sign up for. EM: Absolutely. CA: Please hurry. (Laughs) EM: I mean, the emails that we get\\nat Neuralink are heartbreaking. I mean, they\\'ll send us\\njust tragic, you know, where someone was sort of,\\nin the prime of life and they had an accident on a motorcycle and someone who\\'s 25, you know,\\ncan\\'t even feed themselves. And this is something we could fix. CA: But you have said that AI is one\\nof the things you\\'re most worried about and that Neuralink may be one of the ways where we can keep abreast of it. EM: Yeah, there\\'s the short-term thing, which I think is helpful on an individual\\nhuman level with injuries. And then the long-term thing is an attempt to address the civilizational risk of AI by bringing digital intelligence and biological intelligence\\ncloser together. I mean, if you think of how\\nthe brain works today, there are really two layers to the brain. There\\'s the limbic system and the cortex. You\\'ve got the kind of,\\nanimal brain where -- it’s kind of like the fun part, really. CA: It\\'s where most of Twitter\\noperates, by the way. EM: I think Tim Urban said, we’re like somebody, you know,\\nstuck a computer on a monkey. You know, so we\\'re like,\\nif you gave a monkey a computer, that\\'s our cortex. But we still have a lot\\nof monkey instincts. Which we then try to rationalize\\nas, no, it\\'s not a monkey instinct. It’s something more important than that. But it\\'s often just really\\na monkey instinct. We\\'re just monkeys with a computer\\nstuck in our brain. But even though the cortex\\nis sort of the smart, or the intelligent part of the brain, the thinking part of the brain, I\\'ve not yet met anyone\\nwho wants to delete their limbic system or their cortex. They\\'re quite happy having both. Everyone wants both parts of their brain. And people really want their\\nphones and their computers, which are really the tertiary,\\nthe third part of your intelligence. It\\'s just that it\\'s ... Like the bandwidth, the rate of communication\\nwith that tertiary layer is slow. And it\\'s just a very tiny straw\\nto this tertiary layer. And we want to make that tiny\\nstraw a big highway. And I’m definitely not saying\\nthat this is going to solve everything. Or this is you know,\\nit’s the only thing -- it’s something that might be helpful. And worst-case scenario, I think we solve\\nsome important brain injury, spinal injury issues,\\nand that\\'s still a great outcome. CA: Best-case scenario, we may discover new\\nhuman possibility, telepathy, you\\'ve spoken of, in a way,\\na connection with a loved one, you know, full memory and much faster\\nthought processing maybe. All these things. It\\'s very cool. If AI were to take down Earth,\\nwe need a plan B. Let\\'s shift our attention to space. We spoke last time at TED\\nabout reusability, and you had just demonstrated that\\nspectacularly for the first time. Since then, you\\'ve gone on to build\\nthis monster rocket, Starship, which kind of changes the rules\\nof the game in spectacular ways. Tell us about Starship. EM: Starship is extremely fundamental. So the holy grail of rocketry\\nor space transport is full and rapid reusability. This has never been achieved. The closest that anything has come\\nis our Falcon 9 rocket, where we are able to recover\\nthe first stage, the boost stage, which is probably about 60 percent\\nof the cost of the vehicle of the whole launch, maybe 70 percent. And we\\'ve now done that\\nover a hundred times. So with Starship, we will be\\nrecovering the entire thing. Or at least that\\'s the goal. CA: Right. EM: And moreover,\\nrecovering it in such a way that it can be immediately re-flown. Whereas with Falcon 9, we still need\\nto do some amount of refurbishment to the booster and\\nto the fairing nose cone. But with Starship, the design goal\\nis immediate re-flight. So you just refill\\npropellants and go again. And this is gigantic. Just as it would be\\nin any other mode of transport. CA: And the main design is to basically take\\n100 plus people at a time, plus a bunch of things\\nthat they need, to Mars. So, first of all, talk about that piece. What is your latest timeline? One, for the first time,\\na Starship goes to Mars, presumably without people,\\nbut just equipment. Two, with people. Three, there’s sort of, OK, 100 people at a time, let\\'s go. EM: Sure. And just to put the cost\\nthing into perspective, the expected cost of Starship, putting 100 tons into orbit, is significantly less\\nthan what it would have cost or what it did cost to put our tiny\\nFalcon 1 rocket into orbit. Just as the cost of flying\\na 747 around the world is less than the cost of a small airplane. You know, a small airplane\\nthat was thrown away. So it\\'s really pretty mind-boggling\\nthat the giant thing costs less, way less than the small thing. So it doesn\\'t use exotic propellants or things that are difficult\\nto obtain on Mars. It uses methane as fuel, and it\\'s primarily oxygen,\\nroughly 77-78 percent oxygen by weight. And Mars has a CO2 atmosphere\\nand has water ice, which is CO2 plus H2O,\\nso you can make CH4, methane, and O2, oxygen, on Mars. CA: Presumably, one of the first tasks\\non Mars will be to create a fuel plant that can create the fuel\\nfor the return trips of many Starships. EM: Yes. And actually, it\\'s mostly\\ngoing to be oxygen plants, because it\\'s 78 percent oxygen,\\n22 percent fuel. But the fuel is a simple fuel\\nthat is easy to create on Mars. And in many other parts\\nof the solar system. So basically ... And it\\'s all propulsive landing,\\nno parachutes, nothing thrown away. It has a heat shield that’s capable\\nof entering on Earth or Mars. We can even potentially go to Venus. but you don\\'t want to go there. (Laughs) Venus is hell, almost literally. But you could ... It\\'s a generalized method of transport\\nto anywhere in the solar system, because the point at which\\nyou have propellant depo on Mars, you can then travel to the asteroid belt and to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and ultimately anywhere\\nin the solar system. CA: But your main focus and SpaceX\\'s main focus is still Mars. That is the mission. That is where most of the effort will go? Or are you actually imagining\\na much broader array of uses even in the coming, you know, the first decade or so of uses of this. Where we could go,\\nfor example, to other places in the solar system to explore, perhaps NASA wants to use\\nthe rocket for that reason. EM: Yeah, NASA is planning to use\\na Starship to return to the moon, to return people to the moon. And so we\\'re very honored that NASA\\nhas chosen us to do this. But I\\'m saying it is a generalized -- it’s a general solution to getting anywhere\\nin the greater solar system. It\\'s not suitable for going\\nto another star system, but it is a general solution for transport\\nanywhere in the solar system. CA: Before it can do any of that, it\\'s got to demonstrate it can get into\\norbit, you know, around Earth. What’s your latest advice\\non the timeline for that? EM: It\\'s looking promising for us\\nto have an orbital launch attempt in a few months. So we\\'re actually integrating -- will be integrating the engines\\ninto the booster for the first orbital flight\\nstarting in about a week or two. And the launch complex\\nitself is ready to go. So assuming we get regulatory approval, I think we could have an orbital\\nlaunch attempt within a few months. CA: And a radical new technology like this presumably there is real risk\\non those early attempts. EM: Oh, 100 percent, yeah. The joke I make all the time\\nis that excitement is guaranteed. Success is not guaranteed,\\nbut excitement certainly is. CA: But the last I saw on your timeline, you\\'ve slightly put back the expected date to put the first human on Mars\\ntill 2029, I want to say? EM: Yeah, I mean, so let\\'s see. I mean, we have built a production\\nsystem for Starship, so we\\'re making a lot\\nof ships and boosters. CA: How many are you planning\\nto make actually? EM: Well, we\\'re currently expecting\\nto make a booster and a ship roughly every, well, initially,\\nroughly every couple of months, and then hopefully by the end\\nof this year, one every month. So it\\'s giant rockets, and a lot of them. Just talking in terms\\nof rough orders of magnitude, in order to create\\na self-sustaining city on Mars, I think you will need something\\non the order of a thousand ships. And we just need a Helen of Sparta,\\nI guess, on Mars. CA: This is not in most\\npeople\\'s heads, Elon. EM: The planet that launched 1,000 ships. CA: That\\'s nice. But this is not in most people\\'s heads, this picture that you have in your mind. There\\'s basically a two-year window, you can only really fly to Mars\\nconveniently every two years. You were picturing that during the 2030s, every couple of years, something like 1,000 Starships take off, each containing 100 or more people. That picture is just completely\\nmind-blowing to me. That sense of this armada\\nof humans going to -- EM: It\\'ll be like \"Battlestar\\nGalactica,\" the fleet departs. CA: And you think that it can\\nbasically be funded by people spending maybe a couple hundred grand\\non a ticket to Mars? Is that price about where it has been? EM: Well, I think if you say like, what\\'s required in order to get\\nenough people and enough cargo to Mars to build a self-sustaining city. And it\\'s where you have an intersection of sets of people who want to go, because I think only a small percentage\\nof humanity will want to go, and can afford to go\\nor get sponsorship in some manner. That intersection of sets, I think, needs to be a million people\\nor something like that. And so it’s what can a million people\\nafford, or get sponsorship for, because I think governments\\nwill also pay for it, and people can take out loans. But I think at the point\\nat which you say, OK, like, if moving to Mars costs are,\\nfor argument’s sake, $100,000, then I think you know,\\nalmost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000\\nand be able to go to Mars if they want. We want to make it available\\nto anyone who wants to go. It\\'s very important to emphasize\\nthat Mars, especially in the beginning, will not be luxurious. It will be dangerous, cramped,\\ndifficult, hard work. It\\'s kind of like that Shackleton ad\\nfor going to the Antarctic, which I think is actually not real,\\nbut it sounds real and it\\'s cool. It\\'s sort of like, the sales pitch\\nfor going to Mars is, \"It\\'s dangerous, it\\'s cramped. You might not make it back. It\\'s difficult, it\\'s hard work.\" That\\'s the sales pitch. CA: Right. But you will make history. EM: But it\\'ll be glorious. CA: So on that kind of launch rate\\nyou\\'re talking about over two decades, you could get your million people\\nto Mars, essentially. Whose city is it? Is it NASA\\'s city, is it SpaceX\\'s city? EM: It’s the people of Mars’ city. The reason for this, I mean,\\nI feel like why do this thing? I think this is important for maximizing the probable lifespan of humanity\\nor consciousness. Human civilization could come\\nto an end for external reasons, like a giant meteor or super volcanoes\\nor extreme climate change. Or World War III, or you know,\\nany one of a number of reasons. But the probable life span\\nof civilizational consciousness as we know it, which we should really view\\nas this very delicate thing, like a small candle in a vast darkness. That is what appears to be the case. We\\'re in this vast darkness of space, and there\\'s this little\\ncandle of consciousness that’s only really come about\\nafter 4.5 billion years, and it could just go out. CA: I think that\\'s powerful, and I think a lot of people\\nwill be inspired by that vision. And the reason you need the million people is because there has to be\\nenough people there to do everything that you need to survive. EM: Really, like the critical threshold\\nis if the ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, does the Mars City die out or not? And so we have to -- You know, people talk about like,\\nthe sort of, the great filters, the things that perhaps, you know, we talk about the Fermi paradox,\\nand where are the aliens? Well maybe there are these\\nvarious great filters that the aliens didn’t pass, and so they eventually\\njust ceased to exist. And one of the great filters\\nis becoming a multi-planet species. So we want to pass that filter. And I\\'ll be long-dead before\\nthis is, you know, a real thing, before it happens. But I’d like to at least see us make\\ngreat progress in this direction. CA: Given how tortured\\nthe Earth is right now, how much we\\'re beating each other up, shouldn\\'t there be discussions going on with everyone who is dreaming\\nabout Mars to try to say, we\\'ve got a once\\nin a civilization\\'s chance to make some new rules here? Should someone be trying\\nto lead those discussions to figure out what it means for this\\nto be the people of Mars\\' City? EM: Well, I think ultimately this will be up to the people\\nof Mars to decide how they want to rethink society. Yeah there’s certainly risk there. And hopefully the people of Mars\\nwill be more enlightened and will not fight\\namongst each other too much. I mean, I have some recommendations, which people of Mars\\nmay choose to listen to or not. I would advocate for more\\nof a direct democracy, not a representative democracy, and laws that are short enough\\nfor people to understand. Where it is harder to create laws\\nthan to get rid of them. CA: Coming back a bit nearer term, I\\'d love you to just talk a bit\\nabout some of the other possibility space that Starship seems to have created. So given -- Suddenly we\\'ve got this ability\\nto move 100 tons-plus into orbit. So we\\'ve just launched\\nthe James Webb telescope, which is an incredible thing. It\\'s unbelievable. EM: Exquisite piece of technology. CA: Exquisite piece of technology. But people spent two years trying\\nto figure out how to fold up this thing. It\\'s a three-ton telescope. EM: We can make it a lot easier\\nif you’ve got more volume and mass. CA: But let\\'s ask a different question. Which is, how much more powerful\\na telescope could someone design based on using Starship, for example? EM: I mean, roughly, I\\'d say it\\'s probably\\nan order of magnitude more resolution. If you\\'ve got 100 tons\\nand a thousand cubic meters volume, which is roughly what we have. CA: And what about other exploration\\nthrough the solar system? I mean, I\\'m you know -- EM: Europa is a big question mark. CA: Right, so there\\'s an ocean there. And what you really want to do\\nis to drop a submarine into that ocean. EM: Maybe there\\'s like,\\nsome squid civilization, cephalopod civilization\\nunder the ice of Europa. That would be pretty interesting. CA: I mean, Elon, if you could take\\na submarine to Europa and we see pictures of this thing\\nbeing devoured by a squid, that would honestly be\\nthe happiest moment of my life. EM: Pretty wild, yeah. CA: What other possibilities\\nare out there? Like, it feels like if you\\'re going to\\ncreate a thousand of these things, they can only fly to Mars every two years. What are they doing the rest of the time? It feels like there\\'s this\\nexplosion of possibility that I don\\'t think people\\nare really thinking about. EM: I don\\'t know, we\\'ve certainly\\ngot a long way to go. As you alluded to earlier,\\nwe still have to get to orbit. And then after we get to orbit, we have to really prove out and refine\\nfull and rapid reusability. That\\'ll take a moment. But I do think we will solve this. I\\'m highly confident\\nwe will solve this at this point. CA: Do you ever wake up with the fear that there\\'s going to be this\\nHindenburg moment for SpaceX where ... EM: We\\'ve had many Hindenburg. Well, we\\'ve never had Hindenburg moments\\nwith people, which is very important. Big difference. We\\'ve blown up quite a few rockets. So there\\'s a whole compilation online\\nthat we put together and others put together, it\\'s showing rockets are hard. I mean, the sheer amount of energy\\ngoing through a rocket boggles the mind. So, you know, getting out\\nof Earth\\'s gravity well is difficult. We have a strong gravity\\nand a thick atmosphere. And Mars, which is less than 40 percent, it\\'s like, 37 percent of Earth\\'s gravity and has a thin atmosphere. The ship alone can go all the way from the surface of Mars\\nto the surface of Earth. Whereas getting to Mars requires\\na giant booster and orbital refilling. CA: So, Elon, as I think more\\nabout this incredible array of things that you\\'re involved with, I keep seeing these synergies, to use a horrible word, between them. You know, for example, the robots you\\'re building from Tesla\\ncould possibly be pretty handy on Mars, doing some of the dangerous\\nwork and so forth. I mean, maybe there\\'s a scenario\\nwhere your city on Mars doesn\\'t need a million people, it needs half a million people\\nand half a million robots. And that\\'s a possibility. Maybe The Boring Company could play a role helping create some of the subterranean\\ndwelling spaces that you might need. EM: Yeah. CA: Back on planet Earth, it seems like a partnership\\nbetween Boring Company and Tesla could offer an unbelievable deal to a city to say, we will create for you\\na 3D network of tunnels populated by robo-taxis that will offer fast, low-cost\\ntransport to anyone. You know, full self-driving may\\nor may not be done this year. And in some cities,\\nlike, somewhere like Mumbai, I suspect won\\'t be done for a decade. EM: Some places are more\\nchallenging than others. CA: But today, today,\\nwith what you\\'ve got, you could put a 3D network\\nof tunnels under there. EM: Oh, if it’s just in a tunnel,\\nthat’s a solved problem. CA: Exactly, full self-driving\\nis a solved problem. To me, there’s amazing synergy there. With Starship, you know, Gwynne Shotwell talked\\nabout by 2028 having from city to city, you know, transport on planet Earth. EM: This is a real possibility. The fastest way to get\\nfrom one place to another, if it\\'s a long distance, is a rocket. It\\'s basically an ICBM. CA: But it has to land -- Because it\\'s an ICBM,\\nit has to land probably offshore, because it\\'s loud. So why not have a tunnel\\nthat then connects to the city with Tesla? And Neuralink. I mean, if you going to go to Mars having a telepathic connection\\nwith loved ones back home, even if there\\'s a time delay... EM: These are not intended\\nto be connected, by the way. But there certainly could be\\nsome synergies, yeah. CA: Surely there is a growing argument that you should actually put\\nall these things together into one company and just have a company\\ndevoted to creating a future that’s exciting, and let a thousand flowers bloom. Have you been thinking about that? EM: I mean, it is tricky because Tesla\\nis a publicly-traded company, and the investor base of Tesla and SpaceX and certainly Boring Company\\nand Neuralink are quite different. Boring Company and Neuralink\\nare tiny companies. CA: By comparison. EM: Yeah, Tesla\\'s got 110,000 people. SpaceX I think is around 12,000 people. Boring Company and Neuralink\\nare both under 200 people. So they\\'re little, tiny companies, but they will probably\\nget bigger in the future. They will get bigger in the future. It\\'s not that easy to sort\\nof combine these things. CA: Traditionally, you have said\\nthat for SpaceX especially, you wouldn\\'t want it public, because public investors wouldn\\'t support\\nthe craziness of the idea of going to Mars or whatever. EM: Yeah, making life multi-planetary is outside of the normal time horizon\\nof Wall Street analysts. (Laughs) To say the least. CA: I think something\\'s changed, though. What\\'s changed is that Tesla is now\\nso powerful and so big and throws off so much cash that you actually could\\nconnect the dots here. Just tell the public that x-billion\\ndollars a year, whatever your number is, will be diverted to the Mars mission. I suspect you\\'d have massive\\ninterest in that company. And it might unlock a lot\\nmore possibility for you, no? EM: I would like to give the public access\\nto ownership of SpaceX, but I mean the thing that like, the overhead associated\\nwith a public company is high. I mean, as a public company,\\nyou\\'re just constantly sued. It does occupy like, a fair bit of ... You know, time and effort\\nto deal with these things. CA: But you would still only have one\\npublic company, it would be bigger, and have more things going on. But instead of being\\non four boards, you\\'d be on one. EM: I\\'m actually not even on the Neuralink\\nor Boring Company boards. And I don\\'t really attend\\nthe SpaceX board meetings. We only have two a year, and I just stop by and chat for an hour. The board overhead for a public\\ncompany is much higher. CA: I think some investors probably worry\\nabout how your time is being split, and they might be excited\\nby you know, that. Anyway, I just woke up the other day thinking, just, there are so many ways\\nin which these things connect. And you know,\\njust the simplicity of that mission, of building a future that is worth\\ngetting excited about, might appeal to an awful lot of people. Elon, you are reported by Forbes\\nand everyone else as now, you know, the world\\'s richest person. EM: That’s not a sovereign. CA: (Laughs) EM: You know, I think it’s fair to say that if somebody is like, the king\\nor de facto king of a country, they\\'re wealthier than I am. CA: But it’s just harder to measure -- So $300 billion. I mean, your net worth on any given day is rising or falling\\nby several billion dollars. How insane is that? EM: It\\'s bonkers, yeah. CA: I mean, how do you handle\\nthat psychologically? There aren\\'t many people in the world\\nwho have to even think about that. EM: I actually don\\'t think\\nabout that too much. But the thing that is\\nactually more difficult and that does make sleeping difficult is that, you know, every good hour or even minute of thinking about Tesla and SpaceX has such a big effect on the company that I really try to work\\nas much as possible, you know, to the edge\\nof sanity, basically. Because you know,\\nTesla’s getting to the point where probably will get\\nto the point later this year, where every high-quality\\nminute of thinking is a million dollars impact on Tesla. Which is insane. I mean, the basic, you know,\\nif Tesla is doing, you know, sort of $2 billion a week,\\nlet’s say, in revenue, it’s sort of $300 million a day,\\nseven days a week. You know, it\\'s ... CA: If you can change that by five percent\\nin an hour’s brainstorm, that\\'s a pretty valuable hour. EM: I mean, there are many instances\\nwhere a half-hour meeting, I was able to improve\\nthe financial outcome of the company by $100 million\\nin a half-hour meeting. CA: There are many other people out there who can\\'t stand\\nthis world of billionaires. Like, they are hugely\\noffended by the notion that an individual can have\\nthe same wealth as, say, a billion or more\\nof the world\\'s poorest people. EM: If they examine sort of -- I think there\\'s some axiomatic flaws\\nthat are leading them to that conclusion. For sure, it would be very\\nproblematic if I was consuming, you know, billions of dollars a year\\nin personal consumption. But that is not the case. In fact, I don\\'t even own\\na home right now. I\\'m literally staying at friends\\' places. If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most\\nof Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through\\nfriends\\' spare bedrooms. I don\\'t have a yacht,\\nI really don\\'t take vacations. It’s not as though my personal\\nconsumption is high. I mean, the one exception is a plane. But if I don\\'t use the plane,\\nthen I have less hours to work. CA: I mean, I personally think\\nyou have shown that you are mostly driven by really quite a deep\\nsense of moral purpose. Like, your attempts to solve\\nthe climate problem have been as powerful as anyone else\\non the planet that I\\'m aware of. And I actually can\\'t understand, personally, I can\\'t understand the fact that you get all this criticism\\nfrom the Left about, \"Oh, my God, he\\'s so rich,\\nthat\\'s disgusting.\" When climate is their issue. Philanthropy is a topic\\nthat some people go to. Philanthropy is a hard topic. How do you think about that? EM: I think if you care\\nabout the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it,\\nphilanthropy is extremely difficult. SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink\\nand The Boring Company are philanthropy. If you say philanthropy\\nis love of humanity, they are philanthropy. Tesla is accelerating sustainable energy. This is a love -- philanthropy. SpaceX is trying to ensure\\nthe long-term survival of humanity with a multiple-planet species. That is love of humanity. You know, Neuralink is trying to help\\nsolve brain injuries and existential risk with AI. Love of humanity. Boring Company is trying to solve traffic,\\nwhich is hell for most people, and that also is love of humanity. CA: How upsetting is it to you to hear this constant drumbeat of, \"Billionaires, my God,\\nElon Musk, oh, my God?\" Like, do you just shrug that off or does it does it actually hurt? EM: I mean, at this point,\\nit\\'s water off a duck\\'s back. CA: Elon, I’d like to,\\nas we wrap up now, just pull the camera back\\nand just think ... You’re a father now\\nof seven surviving kids. EM: Well, I mean, I\\'m trying\\nto set a good example because the birthrate on Earth is so low that we\\'re facing civilizational collapse unless the birth rate returns\\nto a sustainable level. CA: Yeah, you\\'ve talked about this a lot, that depopulation is a big problem, and people don\\'t understand\\nhow big a problem it is. EM: Population collapse\\nis one of the biggest threats to the future of human civilization. And that is what is going on right now. CA: What drives you on a day-to-day\\nbasis to do what you do? EM: I guess, like,\\nI really want to make sure that there is a good future for humanity and that we\\'re on a path to understanding\\nthe nature of the universe, the meaning of life. Why are we here, how did we get here? And in order to understand\\nthe nature of the universe and all these fundamental questions, we must expand the scope\\nand scale of consciousness. Certainly it must not diminish or go out. Or we certainly won’t understand this. I would say I’ve been motivated\\nby curiosity more than anything, and just desire to think about the future and not be sad, you know? CA: And are you? Are you not sad? EM: I\\'m sometimes sad, but mostly I\\'m feeling I guess relatively optimistic\\nabout the future these days. There are certainly some big\\nrisks that humanity faces. I think the population collapse\\nis a really big deal, that I wish more people would think about because the birth rate is far below\\nwhat\\'s needed to sustain civilization at its current level. And there\\'s obviously ... We need to take action\\non climate sustainability, which is being done. And we need to secure\\nthe future of consciousness by being a multi-planet species. We need to address -- Essentially, it\\'s important to take\\nwhatever actions we can think of to address the existential risks\\nthat affect the future of consciousness. CA: There\\'s a whole\\ngeneration coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think if you want the future\\nto be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good. And it will be. CA: Elon, thank you for all this time. That is a beautiful place to end. Thanks for all you\\'re doing.

              "[Document(page_content=\"Chris Anderson: Elon Musk,\\ngreat to see you. How are you? Elon Musk: Good. How are you? CA: We're here at the Texas Gigafactory\\nthe day before this thing opens. It's been pretty crazy out there. Thank you so much\\nfor making time on a busy day. I would love you to help us,\\nkind of, cast our minds, I don't know, 10, 20,\\n30 years into the future. And help us try to picture\\nwhat it would take to build a future that's worth\\ngetting excited about. The last time you spoke at TED, you said that that was really\\njust a big driver. You know, you can talk about lots of other\\nreasons to do the work you're doing, but fundamentally, you want\\nto think about the future and not think that it sucks. EM: Yeah, absolutely. I think in general, you know, there's a lot of discussion of like,\\nthis problem or that problem. And a lot of people are sad\\nabout the future and they're ... Pessimistic. And I think ... this is ... This is not great. I mean, we really want\\nto wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited\\nabout what's going to happen. And life cannot simply be about sort of, solving one miserable\\nproblem after another. CA: So if you look forward 30 years,\\nyou know, the year 2050 has been labeled by scientists as this, kind of, almost like this\\ndoomsday deadline on climate. There's a consensus of scientists,\\na large consensus of scientists, who believe that if we haven't\\ncompletely eliminated greenhouse gases or offset them completely by 2050, effectively we're inviting\\nclimate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway\\nto avoid that catastrophe? And what would it look like? EM: Yeah, so I am not one\\nof the doomsday people, which may surprise you. I actually think we're on a good path. But at the same time, I want to caution against complacency. So, so long as we are not complacent, as long as we have a high sense of urgency about moving towards\", metadata={'source': 'YRvf00NooN8', 'title': 'Elon Musk: A future worth getting excited about | TED | Tesla Texas Gigafactory interview', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 8705063, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YRvf00NooN8/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-04-17 00:00:00', 'length': 3984, 'author': 'TED'}),\n",

So I can't emphasize that enough, as long as we push hard\\nand are not complacent, the future is going to be great. Don't worry about it. I mean, worry about it, but if you worry about it, ironically,\\nit will be a self-unfulfilling prophecy. So, like, there are three elements\\nto a sustainable energy future. One is of sustainable energy generation,\\nwhich is primarily wind and solar. There's also hydro, geothermal, I'm actually pro-nuclear. I think nuclear is fine. But it's going to be primarily\\nsolar and wind, as the primary generators of energy. The second part is you need batteries\\nto store the solar and wind energy because the sun\\ndoesn't shine all the time, the wind doesn't blow all the time. So it's a lot of stationary battery packs. And then you need electric transport. So electric cars, electric planes, boats. And then ultimately, it’s not really possible\\nto make electric rockets, but you can make\\nthe propellant used in rockets using sustainable energy. So ultimately, we can have a fully\\nsustainable energy economy. And it's those three things: solar/wind, stationary\\nbattery pack, electric vehicles. So then what are the limiting\\nfactors on progress? The limiting factor really will be\\nbattery cell production. So that's going to really be\\nthe fundamental rate driver. And then whatever the slowest element of the whole lithium-ion\\nbattery cells supply chain, from mining and the many steps of refining to ultimately creating a battery cell and putting it into a pack, that will be the limiting factor\\non progress towards sustainability. CA: All right, so we need to talk\\nmore about batteries, because the key thing\\nthat I want to understand, like, there seems to be\\na scaling issue here that is kind of amazing and alarming. You have said that you have calculated that the amount of battery production\", metadata={'source': 'YRvf00NooN8', 'title': 'Elon Musk: A future worth getting excited about | TED | Tesla Texas Gigafactory interview', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 8705063, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YRvf00NooN8/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2022-04-17 00:00:00', 'length': 3984, 'author': 'TED'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='that the world needs for sustainability is 300 terawatt hours of batteries. That\\'s the end goal? EM: Very rough numbers, and I certainly would invite others\\nto check our calculations because they may arrive\\nat different conclusions. But in order to transition, not just\\ncurrent electricity production, but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the amount\\nof electricity that you need, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt\\nhours of installed capacity. CA: So we need to give people\\na sense of how big a task that is. I mean, here we are at the Gigafactory. You know, this is one of the biggest\\nbuildings in the world. What I\\'ve read, and tell me\\nif this is still right, is that the goal here is to eventually\\nproduce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here a year eventually. EM: We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully we get there\\nwithin a couple of years. CA: Right. But I mean, that is one -- EM: 0.1 terrawat hours. CA: But that\\'s still 1/100\\nof what\\'s needed. How much of the rest of that 100\\nis Tesla planning to take on let\\'s say, between now and 2030, 2040, when we really need to see\\nthe scale up happen? EM: I mean, these are just guesses. So please, people shouldn\\'t\\nhold me to these things. It\\'s not like this is like some -- What tends to happen\\nis I\\'ll make some like, you know, best guess and then people, in five years, there’ll be some jerk\\nthat writes an article: \"Elon said this would happen,\\nand it didn\\'t happen. He\\'s a liar and a fool.\" It\\'s very annoying when that happens. So these are just guesses,\\nthis is a conversation. CA: Right. EM: I think Tesla probably ends up\\ndoing 10 percent of that. Roughly. CA: Let\\'s say 2050 we have this amazing, you know,\\n100 percent sustainable electric grid made up of, you know, some mixture\\nof the sustainable energy sources you talked about.
